i've had my fire hd 8 two weeks now and i love it. this tablet is a great value.we are prime members and that is where this tablet shines. i love being able to easily access all of the prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterthis has a 1280800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing 900 base model. the build on this fire is insanely awesome running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.

i bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. i set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. simple to do and she loves the capabilities. i also bought and installed a 64gig sd card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. for the price i think this tablet is best one out there. you can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.

i purchased the kindle fire because i needed a entertainment only device for long flights. this device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your amazon account. it is worth purchasing a fire tablet if you are an amazon prime member. if not, i would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . my only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.

i did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. i could not depend on it for any length of time so i finally broke down and bought a new one. i am very happy with this one. i was afraid i would lose my music and photos since not all came from the amazon store. however, everything i had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. i am still learning all about it but so far so good.

i find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around.	Vareebadd Phone
i bought this because i was tired of watching youtube and twitch on my phone. excellent display sound is decentnot great but you can always buy a speaker. the negatives areit is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the spectrum tv app is awfulthe app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. all things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

my wife bought this for me for my birthday. i enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. the regular kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. this allows me to see the color photos. i also love the night feature when i'm in bed reading. i no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.	Lightning Charging Cable
thanks to a knowledgeable, lowpressure salesperson, i was ready to buy my first tablet. this one was the right price on sale and i have not been disappointed. every few days i learn more ways to use it besides checking emails checking out library books audio books. it stays charged for days, even with regular use. i recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it's a great tablet for the price. don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. it's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. for the price, you can't beat it. get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. it runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. i've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. it's great for ebooks or other files. some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. battery life seems good for a small table too.the only real issue i have is the amazon app store being limited. it is an offshoot of android but not all the same apps are available. there is a way around it but i wish they would just allow it access to google play or at least offer the same apps.so, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. for the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a 500 tablet. that's not its job.	Macbook Pro Laptop
bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. does everything she wants it to do in a tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
very easy to use tablet. lots of apps and game available.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we love the freetime settings for kids on the newer kindle fires. i was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily can set to more for weekends if desired. you can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. basically, i like that i can set their access rights and know they're safe so i don't have to continually monitor every moment. by the way, freetime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their freetime app access plan.	Macbook Pro Laptop
great tablet, very clear picture. would buy again.	Google Phone
good reader which is why i bought it. ads are annoying.	27in FHD Monitor

i am a prime member i love this tablet. very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. not real tech savvy so i need all the help i can get to keep things simple automatic. great clarity of picturedata. have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size old eyes but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". also, easier to take around in the smaller size. highly recommend especially if you subscribe to amazon and are a prime member. great benefits!

my teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. paired this with a bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this around black friday for 60 hoping it would be awesome. it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro sd cards none of which were recognized and yes i formated them with every format i could think of . fat32, ntfs, fat, xfat. i even tried to have the tablet do it. didnt work. to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps. the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store. i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play coc but it didnt work. launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that. needless to say i returned it and bought a 250 samsung galaxy tab a 10.1 2016 version with spen and its wayyyyy better. bottom line you get what you pay for. also hint the spen version has an extra 1 gb of ram over the non pen version. so you should get that if you can afford the extra 50.

the people i purchased this for during christmas holiday loved it.	USB-C Charging Cable

my 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from santa for christmas. so far she loves it, a little too much perhaps. i only use it to manage her accountpermissions and so far haven't had any issues with it. software and hw not quite as refined as apple ipad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my opinion its a good option for the cost. not as great as apple ipad, but it costs so much less. still can get good use	20in Monitor
has many educational apps i would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who is a very strict of what your children watch on tv or what games and apps they download i would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. in my personal opinion as a mother i feel it helps by setting the restrictionscontent on it helps keep their mind away from the gutter bcuz most apps and internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. we can't control what they put on the internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to i also recommend not putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that i have	Lightning Charging Cable

i am an amazon fan. ive only had amazon tablets so i cant compare them with any other brand. but, amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. the hd 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. its not as good as the kindle fire hdx. the speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. overall its a great tablet for a great price.

i previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. i wasn't to happy with them. but this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly netflix hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube.

overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have prime amazon and the ability to watch amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice	Lightning Charging Cable
i love the size and portability of this. keeps me in touch and having fun.	Wired Headphones

great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for netflix and youtube as well as minecraft and other apps. why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? i'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.	27in FHD Monitor
got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. it is so much to do. so many learning games. i love this product	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i have never owned a tablet. wanted an ipad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. this one fit my needs perfect. i mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. no complaints so far! i would recommend this device.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
also great for listening to music and also for movies	Wired Headphones
the screen picture is crisp and bright. i will use this tablet for many things.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
small and powerful. great adult toy for a reader	Wired Headphones
this was purchased as a christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. for the price, i thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an ipad.for comparison, the closest thing i have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. the fire tablet impresses me! it is more responsive than the existing android tablet i have.this tablet runs fireos which is amazon's customized version of android. typically i do not like custom android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. i am not bothered by that with the fire. if you need them the parental controls are second to none! the amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the google play store. still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.this is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. i will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself.	Lightning Charging Cable
i was hoping to use google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. still cheap and fine for watching movies.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the price is low because amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. the actual tablet works well. the biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the amazon store. there are many android apps available in the google store that are not available in the amazon store.i primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and facebook. in the future i want to try to use it with my local library.	Lightning Charging Cable
screen is very clear and battery last a long time. very good substitute if you can afford a ipad.	USB-C Charging Cable
the tablet works fine. it is responsive with good resolution. it is too tied to amazon. it requires too many hoops to get apps such as zinio to work. until amazon loosens its grip, i recommend only at a very good price.	USB-C Charging Cable
a great value for the money you can save instead of a ipad from apple.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
fun and reliable. good quality for the money. easy to use.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great for reading nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i love my kindle. i won't be without one. i've even bought an extra one, just in case. i believe it's the best tablet on the market.	Google Phone
bought one to replace the smaller non hd version. lot faster and picture is noticeably better. would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra 50 or so on the big names.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. i wasn't looking for anything extreme. just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. well it does that and more. gave it to our son for christmas and now i want one myself. we are going to buy another for my mother in law. lightweight, simple layout. snappy. can't go wrong.

i can do a lot of things on my kindle i used to rely on the computer for.	Wired Headphones
excellent resource for children video streaming by wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the kindle fire tablets are great for the price. they have solid performance in battery life and processing power. the only downside is that the operating system is a different variation of android, so there could be some incompatibilities.	Google Phone
best choice under 100 in marketamazon is the best!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend	Wired Headphones

Wired Headphones
this is the best device i have found for my ebooks. i know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an ereader. it's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. for that limited use, it works fine. i don't think i would want to use it as a general purpose table too slow!. makes a fine ereader though. as for recommending this to a friend, i would, but would make sure they knew what i use it for.	Vareebadd Phone
i bought this as a christmas present for my sister and she loves it. it's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. it's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has downtime. she passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i originally purchased a kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
works well. easy to use. battery seems to be good. would buy again.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
ticks all the boxes i was looking for at a price i was happy to pay. one caveat that i or the best buy and geek squad crews was unaware of there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. kindleamazon are aware of the glitch and will download a thirdparty keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. i made geek squad aware of it and they should know about it now.	Google Phone
amazon mayday functionality is not available and this was unexpected. other services and functionality as expected	USB-C Charging Cable

this is my first amazon ereadertablet and the second ereader i have. it is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. i like the free games and the fact that i new can load books from my computer to the tablet. and one thing, i am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger ereader. it is a lot better than the nook that i have. i love this product	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. i first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use netflixs you can.great product!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet	Wired Headphones
the fire is great. the size is really nice. not to big. the clarity is really good.	Google Phone

my mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one.	Lightning Charging Cable
works great and is fast. great for reading and internet use	20in Monitor
this kindle is so overloaded with apps that i will never use. despite what one of best buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the amazon apps. the apps take up too much of the memory. i have an i pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. unfortunately, it bogs down. i also don't like that amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so i won't use this for emails either. i will likely sell it on craig's list for less than half of what i paid for it.	USB-C Charging Cable
fine for reading, .haven't used it for anything else yet	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have been using a kindle fire for a couple of years. it was a good tablet, until the screen went black. best buy replaced it and i couldn't have been more pleased. i enjoy reading on my kindle fire hd more than ever. try it and you'll buy it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i absolutely love my kindle 8! great picture, storage sound. can't live without my kindle!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. also you can. it use all android apps. the worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. it was fully charged. i have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. kind of a cool paperweight. hope i can get my money back. or get a new one.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
love my mine! works great with prime! and i have all my best movies!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. i set it up for him and he loves it. i just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.	Wired Headphones
enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.	Lightning Charging Cable
got two for my mom's and they love it. so many great features!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this tablet is awesome. the fact that i can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what i wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i'm very happy with my kindle fire. beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. it also holds a charge very long. the size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which i love. i would definitely recommend this tablet to others!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the amazon fire hd 8 is an awesome device. the price of this tablet is mind boggling! this tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. it has amazon store and amazon prime preloaded. it's so much fun and so easy to use. the performance of this tablet is unbelievable. you never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. it feels comfortable in your hands. the design is nice. the size is adequate for all tablet use. you can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240gb. can you believe it? outstanding!	USB-C Charging Cable
bought as a christmas present. son uses it to watch youtube and netflick. works great.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. it is very easy to setup and has features that i did not utilize on previous fire tablets. i like the camera and the blue shade ability. i like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. long lasting battery!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
got this fire tablet for my youngest daughter for christmas and she loves it. i also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age!	27in FHD Monitor
i bought two of these amazon fire hd tablets in december as christmas gifts. both recipients are happy with these as gifts. i plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the amazon interface. it was easy enough to download the google play store, so it was familiar to the user. size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my son really likes the larger screen to play games.	ThinkPad Laptop
very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books,	20in Monitor
they were using them on christmas morning! it didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets	Apple Airpods Headphones
so i think i would have rated 5 stars however when i got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs.the next day it had a reboot screen similar to dos windows. excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. no problems with the second one. great tablet for the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her facebook account easily. she loves the ease of using it. i have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. my mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching netflix as well. very satisfied.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. this fit the bill well. i use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. i don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. we use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. so happy we chose this one. it is lightweight and convenient to take with you.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" kindle fire hd that was out for service. she liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i tested this item before i gave it as a gift. it is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending 100s on an ipad	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this feels like an affordable tablet. while not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. works well. happy with purchase.	Lightning Charging Cable
great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.	ThinkPad Laptop
so easy to download and then read. enjoy reading that i can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book	Flatscreen TV
i bought this after subscribing to an amazon prime membership. this is a great little tablet at such a low price. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. it has the ability to talk to alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read booksmagazines lots of free music and books for prime members.	27in FHD Monitor
if ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! oh you can pay 15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. buy the samsung, better everything!	Wired Headphones
this is my second fire, i'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. love the screen resolution. movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. the camera is a bonus my first version did not have. all together this was a great buy for under 100 on sale. thank you best buy.	Wired Headphones
i would buy it again and have twice over already. i actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle i ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. i would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower gb kindle and then buy a good sd card.	Wired Headphones
this tablet has it all. amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free ebooks and tons of free games. the tablet is intuitive and intelligent. i seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. what i love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro sd card instead for up to 200gb of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. it also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. there is even an option to create children's accountsextra bonus. i am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my samsung smart television. i will definitely consider amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. it maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. i can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. no one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the ownerenduser.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. i have also become addicted to the free underground games.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
bought this 8"" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old kindle fire hd 7 inch model. so far i am very pleased with the quality of this unit. the slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. i didn't want the larger 10"" screen yet.	Flatscreen TV
i purchased this on black friday because i could pass on the price. the tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on amazon. if i were to purchase another android tablet, i will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multitasking.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my son he's 1.5 years old so he could play basic toddler games, but i found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. i'm waiting for the surface pro 5 but this tablet that i got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! for basic lecture taking notes and watching netflix or hulu and kid games, this can't be beat.	Wired Headphones
the best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great purchase for my granddaughter for christmas.	USB-C Charging Cable

great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!	Flatscreen TV
wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. bought on black friday which made the price even better. the screen looks good and the performance for the apps i have used so far have met expectations. i mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. this device handles each with ease. overall, i am satisfied with this device.	Apple Airpods Headphones
works well no issues with reboots or system hangs. good size not too big and not too small. screen is good for reading. battery life is good, i've bought a few books from amazon but mostly sideloaded books from the library onto a 32 gb micro sd card.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
though i have got it for cheap price during black friday, this fire is not that great. very bad camera and dim screen resolution. prosinstall google play without any hasslevery good book reading option	Apple Airpods Headphones
i got it at a great price. they price matched for me. much faster then getting my laptop out to check email	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased this product for my youngest son! he loved the color and the size. the storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded!	Lightning Charging Cable
was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. my first tablet i bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this product is easy to use. screen size is great. would recommend to anyone.	Lightning Charging Cable
i got it for my kid and she loves it. the amazon free time and prime well worth the money	USB-C Charging Cable

less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought for my wife for xmas and she loves it. hasn't put it down	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a good product for video, surfing and reading. however this version has dropped all android support as far as i can tell. i have a couple of apps that run on my old fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. there is one app i use everyday but it doesn't work on this new fire, so i have to keep the old one around. kind of inconvenient. i would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this fire before dropping the money.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
purchased this tablet for my two year old son. it is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
better and faster than kindle 7"". great performance for the price.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
love it, easy to operate. very reasonable price on sale.	USB-C Charging Cable
good product. onboard storage does fill up quickly.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. it's fast enough for apps and great for reading	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
works great but the app store is nothing like that of apple or google. fortunately, you can install many android apps from 1mobile. the screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots making reading books fun.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i love this tablet. i know it's not an ipad or any of the big tablets but it does just what i need it to do. i've had it a few weeks now. i've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. i've had zero problems so far. i know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet i don't expect it to look like my flat screen tv. i'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. so far so good. browsing the internet is easy too. i'm getting used to the browser and the app store for amazon. for the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!

you can do some many things and the best part apps for free on amazon underground!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
works great for my 6 year old. wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. so far so good, and we love the freetime app.	LG Washing Machine
was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran android. the amazon fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. would recommend to anyone looking for a lowerend tablet.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought it as an ereader. convenient and easy to use. text is very readable. i am pleased.	27in FHD Monitor
this is a nice little tablet for the 60 i paid on black friday. at the regular price i would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much amazon content. the lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, i understand amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 1520 amazon apps are a little much. it would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. that said, i was able to install the google play store and this tablet does everything i need it to do. overall, i'm pretty happy with the purchase. it's a nice new toy. one note in the online photos the magenta looks purple. it's actually pink. if you like purple, get a black one and a purple case.	Apple Airpods Headphones
so cool after playing with this for a while now i would never spend the money on an apple for what i am doing with it.	Google Phone
love the new fire hd 8. price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. if i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
had the fire hd 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the tablet is not for me it is for a christmas gift	Lightning Charging Cable
this was a great buy for my son. he needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. this was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon prime account.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this was replacement for my wife's original ipad and broken kindle paperwhite. she loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. great value, especially compared to an ipad.

for the money, you will be well pleased, i think it is a big bargain !	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i purchased this tablet for my mother, but i set it up and tested it out. it is super fast! i have the original kindle fire and all i can say is amazon has come a long way! the new fire hd8 is so much better than the original! i like it so much that i am thinking of purchasing one for myself! i would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!	USB-C Charging Cable
i have had a kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. still adjusting to some different features from the original one. do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one.	Lightning Charging Cable
very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what i was looking for	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my original kindle fire no longer accepted a charge. i wasn't going to replace it, because i bought an ipad. when i saw the hd8 in a kiosk in a bb store, i realized how much better i liked the size and feel of it for reading books the ipad is preferred for other things. this fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. i don't like that i can't choose a photo for the locked screen that it has to be an advertisement. i also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. menial issues from my perspective.	Wired Headphones
it's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the amazon os.	USB-C Charging Cable
got this for my sister as a christmas present and she loved it.easy to use and great for books.	Lightning Charging Cable

this is just the right size and can put games on it just like an ipad.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i wanted a new kindle fir a while. the price was right	27in FHD Monitor
the display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. probably better for reading than watching videos. we didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. wifi works well and internet browsing is fast.	Wired Headphones
the kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
couldn't beat the value for this with the black friday price. they aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price.	Lightning Charging Cable
great size,sound and battery. just buy it already.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. grrat product foe the price.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
she hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i've had my other kindle fire for 56 years. it's still working but slowing down. i bought the updated version while it was on sale. i love it! i play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. it's like a portable mini computer and i wouldn't be without it. i like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. i bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! i'd recommend it to people of all ages.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults	Bose SoundSport Headphones
at ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. overall this is a good tablet for 90, i would recommend this to anyone on a budget.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good starter unit. easy for a beginner to use. priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.	27in FHD Monitor
the parental options need some work. you can't even log in to a child account until you have apps loaded for them to use. also a kid's login doesn't have access to preloaded apps like the calculator. seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.otherwise, the tablet itself works great.	Wired Headphones
bought a fire hd 8 tablet for my wife. she doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. she uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. i use it for everything else reading news, checking email, online shopping, etc. it was very easy to set up and even easier to use. plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want.	ThinkPad Laptop
we already own kindles so we know they are great ! my son is going to live this!	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased 2 of these fire hd tablets as gifts. they pack a lot of punch for the price. i helped set them up so i was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. the screen was very nice and clear. speed of tablet was good. it is easy to use. if you are already in the amazon family through prime it is a nobrainer.i don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought these as a starter online browser. it is a very portable pad . great price.	27in FHD Monitor
just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! it is easy to use and simple to set up!	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i love it.reading e books here is so easyperfect for price	iPhone
with a 20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. much clearer and faster than the other fire hd. light weight too	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
if you shop on amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from nonamazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. this is not a realistic alternative to an ipad or galaxy note. if you just want to a device to shop on amazon with, you'll love it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is my 2nd fire tablet. i will alwyas need one. just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.	USB-C Charging Cable
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!	Apple Airpods Headphones
while there are some apps that are missing due to not using the google play store the list is minimal. the tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. it's great for in front of the tv and catching up on email and light web browsing.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. right on	Lightning Charging Cable
was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.including alex app.fit in top coat pocket	Google Phone
i have been buying kindles since they first came out. when ever i want to upgrade kindle is my chosen brand. i am not very tech savvy and i enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. i like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using texttospeech for the rest.	USB-C Charging Cable
have not used these yet as they are christmas gifts	27in FHD Monitor
wife loves this thing. she reads nonstop on it. she can't put it down	Bose SoundSport Headphones
nice for the price had to put google play store on myself but still a nice tablet	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. the cost is so low you just can't beat it. plus, the main feature for me was the amazon kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. great product and gift.	iPhone
i purchased two of these on black friday. what a great purchase. these are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. i later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal.	Wired Headphones
i love my kindle. i bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.	Google Phone
this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. the picture is great too.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
like that there are lots of apps to choose from. very user friendly	Wired Headphones
i wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just 10 more, so good value ! thin and light weight. easy to start up. i would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. nothing in print came with it other than one paper . tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. i have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish i had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
more features in several ways than ipad. this android tablet is really powerful	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her ipad.	Lightning Charging Cable

love the tablet! easy to use and easy to take with	Wired Headphones
awesome tablet! love using it to read and surf the web.	USB-C Charging Cable
it matters what preference you prefer with tablets. i mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. for me, i use amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. it's made especially for amazon ecosystem users. its light and has a nice feel. i live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading.	USB-C Charging Cable
enjoy having the kindle. my son uses all the time for reading. it has helped him improve in his reading skills. we are glad we bought it. thank you.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this was one of the best birthday presents, i ever purchased for my husband. he said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing fb. i got him a drone for christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. i researched the kindle fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. he farms, so isn't busy in the winter. thank goodness, because he is busy with his kindle for hours every day. he thinks it is great and i do too, because now i have my phone back.	Lightning Charging Cable
i really enjoy reading. so much so i was running out of shelf space. i have read a few books with my ipad mini but it really didn't do the trick. no so with my new amazon fire hd8. handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies"".	34in Ultrawide Monitor
amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the fire hd8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. it has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my second kindle and i love it. it's lightweight, simple, and fast. it's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down.	Apple Airpods Headphones

i will be ordering amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love nana's so much	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. it is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from amazon for free they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.only downside is you need amazon prime to get the most out of your tablet	Lightning Charging Cable
very little set up, amazon helpful in setting up the functions. clear pictures and easy to use. take pictures both ways	Lightning Charging Cable
graphics are great for the price. would highly recommend.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. been wanting to get an ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the pad worked as i thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our ipads. still a great deal for the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
perfect thing i needed to read books on and play my games	USB-C Charging Cable
i'm loving the tablet so far. i really like the amazon underground, and the fire os just updated, so it has alexa on it now.	Macbook Pro Laptop
this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i like the shape and size of this kindle, and the graphics are good. but if i play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. it is very good for books and for music. i would recommend it for those categories.	iPhone
for its price. amongst the others i felt this was a deal	Wired Headphones
perfect size and very responsive. i have 4 of them.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
no issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it is very easy to use for children . we have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids christmas !	27in FHD Monitor
good price for the product. i purchased for my middle school son.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done	USB-C Charging Cable
smartphone works on the job for me, but with the fire i can read instructions and worksheets. it is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
think this will be a great product for my parents it is a christmas gift.	Wired Headphones
the amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. i primarily use it to purchase and read books from kindle. also, i use it for my facebook activity. the battery life is long and it recharges quickly. my 10 year old son also enjoys using it. i would highly recommend this product to others.	USB-C Charging Cable
my husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. this has so much space for him to download things to watch.	Apple Airpods Headphones
a great kindle reader. easy to order, read and store books. also speedy for finding amazon products and ordering them. but the other apps are really slow too slow.	iPhone
easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader	USB-C Charging Cable
not sure if this is due to the new version but i'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. amazon is really trying to lock out nonamazon apps namely ones from google. aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. this was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.	USB-C Charging Cable
tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
still waiting for alexa to function. several calls to amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all fire hd 8 tablets.	Lightning Charging Cable
the amazon fire hd8 has great features. the size is perfect to carry anywhere. excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. you have to be willing to be invested in the amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it.	iPhone
this tablet is a good one for everyday use. it is small but it has a clear image. not sure if i really wanted one this small but its ok for now.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this does not run android, so no google play store. amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through google play. bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. if you have an amazon prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting	Wired Headphones
i like the portability of it. i take it with me when i babysit my granddaughter.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

the kindle fire has great features for the price. the video quality is asstounding.	Product
it worked really well for me as i am unschooled in ipads. i used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things i needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc. i don't play games, so cannot comment on that.	Lightning Charging Cable
if you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.	Flatscreen TV
i use to read books, watch movies, and get online. it works great and easy to use.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this to replace a samsung galaxy tab 3. i absolutely love the kindle hd 8. it was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. the only reason i took off 1 star is that i have found some apps are not available for kindle. but so far from info i have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.	20in Monitor
just a simple kindle. doesn't have the glass back.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
throughly enjoying my fire tablet. can play games and read books. am very pleased with it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent screen , fast response. almost a steal for that price.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
much harder to work than an android. none of the wallpaper apps i downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper 49 tablet. they make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. everything is just harder to work than on a regular android but for a tablet under 100 it exceeds expectations. it is more responsive than other models of fire	Apple Airpods Headphones
kindle fire is a dream. larger screen easy to read	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have been with amazon prime for 2 years and this new fire hd makes it worth it. i watch movies when i fly because i can download them. the battery last for days. i use it everyday now.	Wired Headphones
well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an amazon prime member. you can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. the screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. i have both an ipad and this, and i use both. great when you are waiting for your ipad to recharge.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
reading is easy, can make font as large as you need	Macbook Pro Laptop
improved over the hd 7. things set up differently but not hard to learn. also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder	Lightning Charging Cable
not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet.the only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it.	27in FHD Monitor
i've purchased a number of kindle fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. easy to use for even my youngest grandchildren or my 87 year old motherinlaw which they use as a reader and for games. an overall good value.	iPhone
this is the fastest booting tablet i have come across. the speed at which i can access sites is really amazing.	USB-C Charging Cable
i went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. i loved my kindle, and decided to get 2in1 with the fire. it is perfect for my needs.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. i purchased the fire hd 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire hd 10. the 8 did not have a lot of options i was used to.	iPhone
great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very good product. super quality and the best buy store rep explained me about the product	27in FHD Monitor
this is my third kindle fire and it improves each time. colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this for my sister, who already had the kindle 7. for the price the 8 is better. first the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the hd makes reading and streaming alot clearer. being able to add more storage with a micro sd card is a huge plus as well. this device includes a camera! and last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet.	Wired Headphones
excellent. just as good as ipad with a fraction of the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the amazon fire hd8 2016 model is a great tablet for the price however, the fire os offers limited abilities to the user. personally, i wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a fire tv streaming stick. also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. if it weren't for those two complaint, i'd give this tablet 4 stars.	USB-C Charging Cable
i really love the new shape and size of the kindle hd. my daughter uses it and can control it great.	Lightning Charging Cable
i'm loving this new fire, mainly because i didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. my only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an ipad so don't look great on this	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.	Flatscreen TV
works okay as a tablet and especially to access amazon.no good as a general tablet as there are no google apps available, such as chrome, gmail, etc.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i love this kindle. i love the fact that you can use an sd card for more storage. great job	Flatscreen TV
the device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old	AA Batteries (4-pack)
we have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 34 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .	iPhone
i believe it depends on how you want to use it. i bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. they can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. the only complaint that i have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. you just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch.	Lightning Charging Cable
works well. i really like the bigger screen up from the 7"". easier to read, just as easier to use if not better.	Wired Headphones
this tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. this tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. for its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. installed vlc media player from the app store and filled up the sd drive with movies. now they are nice and quite for hours on end.battery life is awesome!	Apple Airpods Headphones
can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought my fire hd8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. the fact that i saved well over 150 on one of the 5 books i had to get this semester was a godsend. most all undergraduate courses i have seen are offered in ebook form for kindle. if you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without wifi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. prosprice for this was still less than the money saved for my biology book.a lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.so far all books i need for college are available as ebooks through amazon.a single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.consif you wantneed a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another wifi network. bottom line, i wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over 750 in books around. i came out at well under 500 considering i bought this.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps i use in my phone.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. the extra .5 ram makes a difference. very happy and if you're a prime member there are lots of freebies!	27in FHD Monitor
i like this tablet. it has everything you want. however the apps within it need to be updated more often. if this happened than it would be top above an ipad mini. for now, it gives me enough of what i need and in hd. for 89 it was a good deal.	Flatscreen TV
great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. it's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free including inapp purchases. only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them usually products that's on your amazon wishlist. allinall, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it.	Lightning Charging Cable
great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. it is very fast at everything accept game play. for example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. the graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. also it is a amazon tablet with no google play store but you can load google play on to it. there are great you tube videos on how to put google play on a amazon tablet. the screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. the stereo speakers sound great and loud. all in all i really liked the tablet for the price but i really like to play games with good graphic quality. so that being said i did return this tablet and ordered the nvidia shield 8 inch tablet through best buy for 199 dollars. i got the shield a week ago and wow! what a difference in graphic gaming quality. this thing is just as good as an xbox1 or ps4. the nvidia shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the apple or samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. the amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period! i don't know why bbuy kind of hides the nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. if they displayed it in the store. this would outsell the apple or samsung tablets. i hope this helps thanks.

i find this fire much lighter and very easy to use	Vareebadd Phone
i use this primarily as a reader however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other kindle readers. as a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that i have used for internet purposes. i would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader.	Apple Airpods Headphones
does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great little tablet for a great price. i keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.	ThinkPad Laptop
wanted to travel without my laptop. found the fire to be perfect. used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with facebook posts of friends. found the size of screen to be easy to read. typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. have yet to use as an ereader.	Flatscreen TV
great tablet to replace kindle. love the features.	iPhone
this is a great tablet for my teen. she loves it and the price can't be beat!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this is a great tablet. it has amazing storage. i use mine daily. great for reading, surfing the web and games. the one small thing i don't like is amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. hulu and netflix work wonderful.	ThinkPad Laptop
the kindle is great to read on. i also like that you can play some games.	Lightning Charging Cable
i love the amazon tablet very much and love to use	Bose SoundSport Headphones
its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for my wife to replace her 7"" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. she is thrilled! it was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. she mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage	Bose SoundSport Headphones
if you don't want or need something cheaper than an ipad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.the processor makes for a fluid ride with it. it's speedy. the android store gives you good app options and the amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.the software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.for a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
easy to read. light in weight. has many good features.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i read about this new 8"" amazon tablet in the new york times. my google nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and i needed to upgrade for as little money as possible.this amazon fire 8"" is an excellent value for the moneyonly 89! very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. i was skeptical of the silk browser, which i'd never heard of, but it works fine. there is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but i can live with that.it has exceeded my expectations and i'm very happy with it. i'm not in the amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! congrats to amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!also, the purchasing experience at best buy was easy and convenient, as always!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the new fire hd 8 is an improvement over the fire hd 7"". it is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. i do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. too much glare in those places.	USB-C Charging Cable
love it! i'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help.	USB-C Charging Cable

the new fire hd 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. storage doubled to 16 gb and the ram increased by 50 to 1.5 gb. this makes the tablet faster and more responsive. with the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet.

got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. she does not like androids at all but i couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. so we took a chance with this one. she is pleased and i'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. going to get our youngest child one now. very pleased.	Lightning Charging Cable
the quality of display is better than expected for the price. keep in mind that this is not an ipad!. apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. very satisfied with the product. this review is for fire hd 8, 16 gb.	27in FHD Monitor
i like it but i had a hard time figuring things out.do i get to talk to geek squad free? can i come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.will there be a fee for that service?	27in FHD Monitor
beautiful hd resolution on this tablet. love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps i need for personal entertainment if you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable i strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment.	iPhone
i bought 2, 1 for each kid. easy to set up and figure iut. i went with the staff member's recommendation and i am so glad i did. i love the internet safety organ on it through amazon. 2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe internet access and movies, books, games and apps and i can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. love love love.

good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very happy with my kindle. would buy it for my kids	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i am a power user there's no other way of putting it. i work in it and i research the heck out of products before i buy. i had an ipad mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with ios 10 so i sold it and bought and eventually returned the 2016 fire hd 8. first let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 5060 of tablet users who surf the web and watch netflix. it also helps if you are a heavy amazon content user. for me, i was spoiled by the retina display on the ipad. the 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. the other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. it's glare city on this thing. display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. if you don't play really heavy games which it even plays titan quest surprisingly well! and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen i think it runs and works fine. it just wasn't for me. i bit the bullet and went with a 128gb ipad air 2 as its on special at bb for super cheap right now.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is not a bad product. amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. the lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.	Lightning Charging Cable
so i got my fire hd 8 originally for ebooks since ecopies are much cheaper. very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. so glad i got this.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this was a good tablet. i bought it for my gf who basically only wanted it for netflix and youtube. the display was good, not great. the issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. this could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought the kindle for my daughter. it's the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. great product	Wired Headphones

i bought the fire hd 8 casei use it mostly for class.works very good.would be better if it had bluetooth.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
we have several kindles and this is the latest version. its packed with amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. this new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. one problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family memberskids they may end up with the same stuff on them. my kids mainly use them for game apps and youtube videos which am seem to work great. the sound is good and the hd video is nice. overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.

i went into best but to buy another reader but ended up buying a fire 8 good value and has the things i need in a reader.	Lightning Charging Cable

i have always gone to buy a kindle because i like the books and th games available. but i found them very unpredictable and unreliable. the color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. as a result i have purchased 8 over the years. not sure if want to go through that for the 9th time!	Apple Airpods Headphones
it's good, saves using up data usage on computer. i use it to keep up to date with the news.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!	27in FHD Monitor
this is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew	USB-C Charging Cable
my kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.	Vareebadd Phone
i'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. everything about it is good and i really like it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
at the price it is almost an impulse buy. i wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. if you are used to an ipad, the fire hd is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. it fit my needs but i felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. if you go in with the understanding this isn't an ipad replacement this should fit the bills for you. let's just say, after my trip i purchased an ipad pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. if you have amazon prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item.

easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i am very happy with this amazon tablet. i purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. i did get an sd card for more memory. also, if i would have bought directly from amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. however, i was able to order from best buy online, and pick it up that very day!

its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. it has a very good resolution quality.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

this tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. it has been a great tablet. the battery life is great on these new models. also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. the durability of the tablet is great. this thing won't break if you drop it. the only thing i don't like is the fire os. you can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.	ThinkPad Laptop
i have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what i loved about this one is that the screen is big so when i am reading a book it's a lot easier than when i had the first kindle screen. i mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when i want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. i love it!

unlike my first kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when i first turn it on. i could live without that, but overall, i am pleased with this new tablet. it does many things i haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon.	27in FHD Monitor
this is a great tablet for the price. would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. otherwise, definitely recommend.	Lightning Charging Cable

perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader.	Macbook Pro Laptop
this tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things amazon. the included browser silk is not the best. i purchased expanded memory 64gb sd card for about 30 more and a cover for about 20. the biggest issue i have with this unit is that it is slow when compared to an ipad and it tends to freeze every so often. for about 2.5x more money, consider an ipad instead.

amazon fire hd8 is one of the best deal at 89. strong, efficient, low price and some amazon features that i love. youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. and now, microsoft office is available online for free that i can access and edit my documents. what else do i need? amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or usedold models of high price brands. definitely recommend it.

this replaced my old kindle fire. i have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality	20in Monitor
i would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.	Lightning Charging Cable
kids love it, under 100 so the price is great. don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. still can't get them off the ipad though.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. from the start i was on the phone every day for at least an hour with amazon tech support for one issue or another. most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. at one point i asked one of them about trying to save some ram and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between ram and regular storage. the internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. then a day would pass and i'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working.wtf? come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". after two weeks of one thing after another i got fed up and just returned it. i wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. to me it was like walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is amazon. if i were you i'd look at a regular android tablet from a reputable pc manufacturer, which is exactly what i did next. i got an asus tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000 better in comparison to the amazon fire hd8. save yourself the aggravation and go with asus or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. sorry amazon, not this time!	Apple Airpods Headphones
not very fancy, but not slow. if you have amazon prime, you have a access to a great library of tv shows and movies for free. same goes for free book rentals. the amazon app store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. just not the latest versions you would expect. but the amazon underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. it's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy.

i love my kindle fire. had a kindle and it disappeared. enjoy not having to go to library for books. i get a great selection of books every day.	Lightning Charging Cable

this is a great tablet for the price! i bought it to replace my ipad mini. great for ereading and general browsing.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this replaced a kindle 7 hdx with 32gb of ram. the older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. had the geek squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the hd8 as his new tablet. other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. my son didn't care about the resolution and the new kindles let you pop in an sd card for more storage. popped in a 64gb sd card and he's a happy camper now.

i purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. it's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. handles all apps and hd content well.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i enjoy the new kindle, only things i would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. not sure how to stop that. occurs consistently. also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. that is bothersome. otherwise, am happy with the kindle.

i purchased the 8 inch device. also purchased black cover.i played for it and asked if i could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. i did not have 40 more dollars so i left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. i was disappointed i had to get someone else to set up my kindle.

my previous kindle was dying and i wanted a new replacement fast. i went to amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. expecting to pay more i went to best buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and i could pick it up the same day!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i got this for my son to play games on soi could get my ipad back. personally i think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. but it works for what it's intended for andi have no problems.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use you cant beat it for the price you pay	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. some features i don't use so can't comment on them. all in all i love it.the only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this kindle.	Google Phone
we purchased this as a replacement for our nowbroken ipad. though we liked the smaller size more convenient, easier to carry, etc, the internet was sooooooo slo that it drove us crazy. sometimes minutes to download a site and this with no other apps open!1. plan to go back to another ipad.

no problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my nephews love to play with my phone. now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. however, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. the kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. and best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate murphy's law in action.

was a present for my 14 year old grandson. he was very pleased.	Wired Headphones
the kindle fits me to a ""t"". very quick to start. it shows how to get things done.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
for under 100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. i do all i want on it like check email, facebook, twitter, watch youtube, read books, and shop on ebay or amazon. i've been very pleased with my purchase.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it	Lightning Charging Cable
i love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.	27in FHD Monitor
i know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. but it's the best bargain at this price point . the screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. but if you want to enjoy videosthis is not your choice.the processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from google appstore even though the os based on android. but few tweaks let you install the google playstoresearch online for the steps.overall i'm satisfied with my purchase. hope this is helpful.

i bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. you can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection.	USB-C Charging Cable
it is just an average tablet. bit slow but is a good option for people on budget	Bose SoundSport Headphones

love how i am able to run the latest minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3yearold ipad. it seems as apple handy cap their devices. resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine	Lightning Charging Cable
i love my fire hd8 i got it because my kindlethe original that my husband bought me died and the verizon tablet wasn't working great for me. so i came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but i love it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
does all the basic stuff i need at a great price. i use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. picked this over the fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and cpugpu. battery life is pretty good. ads aren't too annoying.far cheaper than competing namebrand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. fireos will always be a little behind the current android version and i'd rather have google play than amazon, but this still allows for sideloading stuff.recommend if you're ok with living in amazon's world andor proficient enough to load other app stores or packages or know somebody can.	Lightning Charging Cable
this item work just as i expected it to, great product!	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is the third fire we've purchased, and amazon finally made this level memoryupgradable. that has made all the difference. i bought fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great.until you run out of memory. 8gb is practically nothing these days i remember when having 64kb was a huge upgrade to my atari! so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i love amazon fire hd8. it is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising social media. i love that it has alexa included on it.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i love my kindle for reading manga and comics. the fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that i cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. this is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. the increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book.	iPhone
this thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. going to try and take it back	Lightning Charging Cable

this was an impulse buy. while getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife i decided i'd get this for myself. it did the job just fine, but after about a week i returned it. i just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. the price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then i don't think you can go wrong.	Wired Headphones
i use this all the time. so much better than bringing out the laptop.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market.

i traded this in after receiving a 7"" at christmas and i am happy i did. i love the size of the screen for reading my books which i have too many of and a great size for watching movies. i do wish i had the capability to use internet when i am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy.

overall i like the fire hd8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. good companion to prime membership, wouldn't be half as good without.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old galaxy tab. this tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. the screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. the modified android system that amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. all in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.prospriceperformancefeels sturdyeasy to navigatesilk browser works greatconsnot all apps are supported on here, like telegramads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrancenot as customizable as other android tabs	Apple Airpods Headphones

this tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. the built in amazon pieces for prime members is great and work flawlessly. but it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes. they need to take a lesson or two from apple.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i have only used this a few times so far, but i like it. the lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. perfect screen size too. i ended up purchasing a second one for my fianc.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

really nice customer first service. i have had other kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. i downloaded movies from netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. i love the ability to expand the memory with a microsd card, which ipads do not. it's pretty fast and has all the features i need. i read kindle books with it as well. the drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. the ipad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps i use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.

before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. the screen is bigger, more storage amd love the color on the back. great tablet	AA Batteries (4-pack)

after having a basic kindle for 6 years, i moved up. i am thrilled with all this product can do. i am an avid reader. the fire let's me do that and lots of other things. i am still finding apps, and other things it will do. i know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! thanks for asking.

if you need a basic tablet then the fire works. it falls apart when compared to the ipad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
worked great but after awhile i wouldn't unlock. after i'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. i took it to geek squad luckily i bought the protection plan! and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. so i got another one but that one did the exact same thing. ended up returning that one too.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and i to use. neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. every time we open it advertisements pop up. and we just try buttons to remove it. we cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. just too complicated to use and to navigate around. i will be returning it. we have an ipad and it's much easier.

only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the kindlefire with any light in the room at all far worse than impossible in sunlight. there should be some sort of temporary screen or other addon that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.	Wired Headphones
i like this and the price is right enjoying it now	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this as a gift for my daughter! she is diabetic and losing her vision. i am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.	Vareebadd Phone

i like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. it's great for kids and adults as well.	Wired Headphones
have been pleased with my purchase of the fire hd8 as it's video quality is great when viewing espn3netflixyoutube tutorials.the ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the amazon kindle app is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an ipad.	Wired Headphones

i bought this kindle for my husband's birthday. i have had a kindle since 2013 and i used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. my husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. now, with the new kindle he actually multitasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! i think his kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
it is easy to use. it was cheap. have not found anything about it that i do not like.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net	Lightning Charging Cable
love this tablet. bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now.	Lightning Charging Cable
make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a good product but the one i bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the geek squad guy told me when i brought it back that i had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. wrong answer. that should never have to be done. he had no idea what he was doing and north haven best buy didn't offer to fix or replace my kindle. this is the third product i have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. one manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if i understand best buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. if that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the point of sale, keep selling defective products, the north haven store has a big problem.

i bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. i set this up for my son with special needs. i tried to make it as simple as possible for him. it is a little bigger. the sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. it also seems very slippery. i got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. that seems to help us to grip it better. over all, it's a good tablet for a child. just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it.	iPhone
reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so i guess that is what counts.	Lightning Charging Cable
my bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. it's just like my 7"" although larger. i cannot tell the different between the regular and the hd and i game on it. i'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. if you're a firsttime tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. but if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . the fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing.	Flatscreen TV

i purchased this for a small child to use. she is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste.	Macbook Pro Laptop
my new kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old kindle fire. as to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. i still use my old kindle as it is still ticking but the ""shiny new toy"" is fun.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the second fire tablet that i have purchased. the first i returned in after i was not able to load youtube onto the tablet. amazon's take on android was just to unfriendly to make it work. with this new tablet, amazon has heard my concern and now i'm enjoying this tablet. it's well built for a sub100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse.	USB-C Charging Cable
reliable, price efficient device. easy to use for all ages.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. i can check my email or just about do anything i can do on a regular computer.i strongly recommend it.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is a terrific tablet at a great price. the quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. and oh, did i mention that it's cheap? cheap for a tablet, that is.	USB-C Charging Cable
had a great experience with my best buy rep! great job!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
small, portable and very easy to use. i have not had any issues as of yet.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. i expected to hand it to my 10year old after my exam. the surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular i like the amazon account integration on my next flight i was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! the best part is that i upgraded the memory with a 64gb sd card so now my available content is awesome! truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but best buy replaced my unit right away and i expect great things with this new device! my son also uses it on long trips!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought the hd fire 7 for my wife,i liked hers decided to buy the fire hd 8 for myself i love it.nice graphics easy to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
able to download music and movies free!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have used the kindle mostly for reading. i have downloaded books from amazon, some free some purchased, that i have heard about for years and now will read. i have also read manga from the internet. my use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
need to have some computer savvy. wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this was a gift for my son and he loves it. it not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!	Lightning Charging Cable
you cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. the only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. if this came with the google play store, i would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. overall it is a great tablet at this price point. i would highly recommend it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. luv it!	Macbook Pro Laptop
very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.	Wired Headphones
love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this tablet is not only a great price but exactly what i needed for quick internet access and to download books !	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased the amazon fire hd 8 to replace my 2nd generation kindle fire. it works great and the colors are sharp.	USB-C Charging Cable
the 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. it also has more storage and a camera. love it!	ThinkPad Laptop
i lost my tablet in germany and wanted a replacement fast. best buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, i decided to go with the 8 inch. boy was i glad that i did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and netflix on the airplane. the 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. overall i am really happy with this tablet	34in Ultrawide Monitor
pros hd quality for low price. works really well with my amazon account to access multiple amazon features with extreme ease. couldn't be happier. i have ipads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. love it!	iPhone
we bought this one and a black one for our kids. it's very durable and good price for the quality. for myself personally, i still prefer my ipad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. it's so simple i sometimes struggle using it. the free time experience is awesome for little ones and i can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. for a firsttime tablet user, this is a solid product.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
a very good product by amazon. considering the price, even better.	27in FHD Monitor
good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot.	USB-C Charging Cable
excellent product. i would definitely purchase again.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
after using this tablet for a while, i have found that i even prefer this size over my ipad air. easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. the screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. i highly recommend this sweet tablet.	ThinkPad Laptop
this was a birthday gift for my little one and she loved it!	Google Phone
i purchased two of these as christmas presents for my children. i had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. i found the 7"" fire kids edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, i found myself unsure of it. i was mostly interested in the freetime application, so i did some research on that and found that it was available on other fire models also. i came across the new fire hd8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. i gave them a shot and i'm glad i did.i have the fire hd8's locked into freetime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that i approve of, but if i want to, i can pick up either of them and unlock them to access netflixamazon prime or anything else i desire. i currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to x amount of time per day. freetime also has a bedtime feature which disablesenables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.the hardware itself is exceptional. the screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! they advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. the only con i can think of is that the cameras are subpar, but that's not what i purchased the tablets for, so it's a nonissue for myself.some of the reviews i read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with freetime content, so i installed 128gb sd cards in them. i also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of amazon.this is probably one of the best purchases i have made in a long time. the sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. we love it except for the fact it would not connect to att internet. i suspect this was an att problem. the internet could not be authenticated. since we have had problems with att for seven years, i am sure it was a problem with them! once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!	27in FHD Monitor
great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again	Bose SoundSport Headphones
overall, very impressed especially when compared to my ipad mini 4. this tablet does it all and makes for an excellent ereader, while also boasting specifications that rival any ipad.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos	Apple Airpods Headphones
my wife loved her gift. i made the right purchase.	ThinkPad Laptop
i own two amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned. my sister in law wanted a tablet and since i owned one just like this one i figured it to be a good buy. she just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs. it's a great alertanative to an ipad. great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.	Apple Airpods Headphones
these kindle fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an amazon prime account it would be a crime not to have a fire tablet.good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. they are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
we bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it.	Flatscreen TV
this is my first tablet and it's going well so far. i purchased this for reading and streaming. there have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes i have trouble with response on commands, but overall, i'm happy. it's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline.	iPhone
replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. very pleased with the large screen.	ThinkPad Laptop

i bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. the device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. if you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.	Apple Airpods Headphones

great little tablet after you add google play store. takes some research to do.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
awesome tablet and great value for money. my son is enjoying it a lot.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, ipad 2, until i could spring for the ipad pro. got it as a black friday deal, so it was more than worth it. was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than i thought it could be, and having amazon prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. i carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. can't beat it for the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love to read! books,books, books and more books.	iPhone

my son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. he wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. he's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!	Wired Headphones
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told i had to deal with amazon.found out thru amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. had to research everything myself.

AA Batteries (4-pack)
i decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and i do not regret my decision at all!the only con for those evaluating this as a tablet is that amazon has their own app store. many apps from googleplayappstore are simply not available.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
we had an old fire and upgraded to the fire hd. love everything about it so far.	Macbook Pro Laptop
the fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge.	Macbook Pro Laptop

got this tablet cause i wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use hulu and netflix on it. my only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for 15 other than that it's a grade little tablet!

AAA Batteries (4-pack)
very competitive price unit works well we like color and size	Macbook Pro Laptop
the hd8 and hd7 are amazing for the price. they aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. right now, in feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the nexus 7.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bought this for my niece and she loves it. very easy to use from what she tells me!	Wired Headphones
i really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.	USB-C Charging Cable
such a a great tablet that does everything, love it!	Lightning Charging Cable
i am an avid amazon user for shopping and tablets, i bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this amazon tablet is perfect for them! it's user friendly and if you have an amazon prime account has great access to movies and music.	USB-C Charging Cable
i've had ipad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. however, that being said. i bought this tablet for the purpose to watch netflix and read books on. in my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. the screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey i didn't pay 300 for it either. i like this size and it seems fast. i'd have to say i like it a lot. on another note, i'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at best buy and their shipping. this is about the 3rd time i've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and best buy said it would be here at a certain date and ups screws it up every time. don't have any issues anywhere else but always when i order from best buy and have it mailed to me. anyways, the tablet is good for the price and i'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. we have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account but with careful monitoring, it's ok.	27in FHD Monitor

it was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the hdfire. it was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. the os is pretyy premitive. the hardware does fell nice. i would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.	ThinkPad Laptop
i have owned several kindles. i don't know what i do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. thank goodness for best buy's extra protection. the last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. excellent customer service as well!	Flatscreen TV

the screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. great colors also!	Lightning Charging Cable
not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the amazon programs	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read andor listen to books. after a slow start getting her going she is not tech savvy she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
for the price it can't be beat. that being said i had to return mine after a week. i just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. it works well for movies and the web, but i needed it to also show off my photos to others.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

bought this for my 8 year old in place of a nabi that didn't work out of the package. great basic tablet for this.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
as i reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items i was looking for. it is a great tablet, but there are a few things i don't really like about it. i didn't realize that amazon has it's own browser silk. everything even your banking info goes through amazon. not sure i like that. also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and i have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. it might just be that i am not that computer savoy, though i do know how to navigate my way around. sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that i am attempting 'touch'. lastly, the onoff button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so i am often 'accidently' shutting it down. most annoying! overall, i am happy with my purchase and for the price i like it. just wanted to point out the other items.	Wired Headphones
serves all my needs in a economy tablet and i would reccomend it to all.	ThinkPad Laptop

i picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .	34in Ultrawide Monitor
we previously bought a 7 inch, 8 gb kindle for my son which he used a lot. eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. this past christmas we purchased the amazon fire hd8, 16 gb.this model was an improvement over the previous one. with twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. another great feature is the external sd card slot. we bought a 32 gb card and he's not had to delete anything.the quadcore processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. there also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.this is a great purchase for any child!	USB-C Charging Cable
excellent product.relable.maximum speed.fast downloading	Flatscreen TV
love this tablet. it's big enough so i can see. it works with my prime so i can watch movies or stream music.	Google Phone
i purchased a kindle a few years ago and have loved the flexibility it give me. i can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. i love the fact that i can continue to read my books while i travel. doctor office visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because i can ignore the office chatter and the tv selections i rather not watch. i encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. this is my second purchase. love it!

i use it mainly for reading ebooks and browsing. however, i wished there were more apps available. also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. if the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. you can pay 15 to disable the ads permanently. i only recommend this for basic use. if you want to use it for games or other apps, i would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is my second kindle fire, and the only reason is because i upgraded. they're a great little tablet. very versatile and fast loading times. definitely recommend.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

can't say enough about the kindle fire. it literally is fiiiiiiyah. fast, easy to use, and an allaround perfect tablet. recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise i'd say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get.

my husband and i purchased the new amazon kindle fire hd 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for christmas. i have an older version 7 in myself so i already knew we were buying a durable tablet. the new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom we purchased during black friday and got them for 30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. we had shopped around many places prior to and. they are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. they seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.the tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. will buy again in the future if these ever quick working.

the 8 inch amazon fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the amazon market. the 7inch is a nice size, but the 8inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. if you are an amazon prime member, this is a must have tablet. also, the amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleekness.

i got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16 hour flight, but also just in general. was in line buying something when i saw this at an unbelievable price! so i bought it and have no regrets! for the price 69.99 it's a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the android app store, which limits you. but that's alright, as i mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. and occasionally some games!	20in Monitor

i bought two kindle fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past christmas. we downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! no need to buy them an ipad which was far more costly!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i have had every version of the kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a kindle fire. i replaced the first one i had in 2014 and it was everything i wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. so.i got this one. first of all i miss swype. why get rid of it? secondly i cannot put two of my favorite apps which work on my old one to work on this but lastly and most importantly every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off andor leaving it for awhile brings it back to life and it turns itself off. it seems to happen when i close a program and move to a new one. aggravating and not what i expect from a product with which i have been happy in the past.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
my granddaughter love this fire for al her games. we also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. so many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought a kindle fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. so we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for christmas. i cannot believe the improvement over the previous kindle fire we own. the screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. for the 89.99 they currently sell for i would say it is an excellent value. if you can wait, we paid less at christmas so a lower price could be seen again.

i had microsoft surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. since went back to laptop for work didn't need another surface. settled on 8"" kindle hd over samsung and ipad mini due to value. i only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. this is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. great value as i paid under 100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my surface for these basic uses.

ok its not an ipad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.my only complaint is that it don't have a true gps chip and relies on your wifi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true gps. but it is a great travel tablet and with an sd card you can download your amazon or other content and watch offline. a great travel tablet!

for the price you get alot of valuegreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube	iPhone
i got a magenta color because i loved the beautiful purpleish color shown on the picture. instead i got a really bright pinkish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. i went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since i bought it on sale, i had to pay the 30 dollar price difference if i wanted to exchange. unbelievable. the product is good but i never liked the best buy customer service.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this product met all of our my needs and i would recommend it to others.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet but.ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. it was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. ended up just using my lenovo yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have the hd 7 and an hdx 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. if you are an amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. the screen is bright and crisp. the processor performs very well with the latest software update. i love it.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bought to use for recent travel. was able to download several movies and tv shows from netflix. seems to have decent storage. video playback was fine.	Lightning Charging Cable

this is actually a pretty good little tablet. it is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. but for the price, you can't go wrong. it does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. a perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips.

amazon fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last black friday event. excellent purchase.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

for the price, this tablet is not bad. i found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. the wait is very annoying.	Lightning Charging Cable
for the price, you can't beat this tablet. it is fast and basic.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had problems with my white page and was in the process of buying ad new kindle i found this was a better unit for my use than tine whitepage.	Apple Airpods Headphones
perfect for the price. it is great to bring with you on the go. and like i said can't beat the price. the only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. the battery is great. i would absolutely recommend this product.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this tablet is not a hightech stateoftheart speed demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. the two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with alexa built in, and, you can download amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. these two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on black friday. as an amazon product, it offers amazon apps. while you can get google play apps, it requires some hoops. i just discovered i can't save movies from netflix because that only applies to the hdx version. so this product has limits. but used as a kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses wifi only while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice.

this kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. at the time i felt it was a steal at that price. the first tablet i purchased a few years ago was the original kindle fire, the following year i purchased an ipad mini and now have the ipad mini 4. as you may already know, the ipad does not have explandable memory. this kindle can have expanded memory to 200gb so that was a good selling point for me. after setting this new kindle fire up, i noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original ipad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenishyellowish tint to it. some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. i'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. i was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were vulcans. i also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in pdf format. the kindle will read this format but the kindle fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc. it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. if you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. that was enough for me, i've been spoiled by the ease of use of the ipad and the display with accurate colors. back to the store for a prompt refund it went. overall.still a good deal but if you are used to an ipad for the reasons i am.you may be disappointed.	iPhone
works well. but does not offer access to the apple or android app store. without the apps that i need, this tablet is not as useful.	Lightning Charging Cable

while the fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. the screen resolution is what i would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution and far more expensive tablets out there.overall, i am pleased with this tabletso far.

the fire hd tablet is a good product. the screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. however, the major issue i have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet. and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. so, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me.	27in FHD Monitor

the amazon fire hd8 is a great tablet at a bargain price. purchased at christmas time for 59. it's an even better value if you have an amazon prime account. only downside is the use of amazon's appstore instead of the google play store which has more variety.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought 3 three of these for my boys for christmas gifts. great little tablet. perfect for everything they want to use it for.	Wired Headphones

i use the hd8 for my personal entertainment system	20in Monitor
i have had many tablets, samsung, asus and old ipad. this fire holds its own . the silk system is not quite as speedy but the lack of bloatware is nice. there is a hack to get more google apps. it's light to hold, the ads are not invasive. i enjoy taking advantage of the prime benefits. simple to operate. would recommend for everyday use and moviereading music consumption.	iPhone

this baby is a bargain. very good screen, decent overall quality and performance.and now alexa. i use it with bluetooth speaker and it has become my office music machine. hold the home button and ask alexa to play easy jazz. no muss no fuss. improves upon 'regular' alexa because she has a screen now!.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i got exactly what i was expecting with this purchase, a low cost device for media consumption ebooks, movies, music with surprisingly decent performance in the few games i've tried on the device. the microsd expansion card slot is a musthave for me when purchasing any tablet device.

this was a gift for grandchildren. i am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
perfect cheap device for kids and grandkids nice to have sitting around	Lightning Charging Cable
this fire hd 8 is my first such device. i find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.the touch screen control takes getting used to as i often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. the alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. i shut her off since i'm not a fan of conversing with computers.my main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. the wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. there are no instructions on how to use thisdevice no sample book to test and get familiar with. there is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. the wifi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. it has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. the cable can be used toattach to a windows pc and transfer files books, music, pictures etc. i would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one i purchased 3 years ago. the screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the sd card, and just an allaround good product. and a great value.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

great product simple easy to understand great value!	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's fire tv hdx 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life and i was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode hevc, like the fire tv 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. this unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. we will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great price and good quality screen image in a nice 8"" format. i installed a 128 gb microsd card with no problems. i was impressed with the quality of the device and it fit a generic tablet cover that was too big for the 7"" generic tablet i had previously purchased. i wished i had gotten a few more during the black friday sale. it came with a charger and cable.

hoped this fire hd 8 would be faster than my old hd fire.not so much, i guess i expected the new fire hd 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the internet. my wife's ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 6070 dollar tablet.

the amazon fire hd8 16gb is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's pricepoint. it cannot be compared with a miniipad at a fraction of the price. the other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. all in all for the money, its a nice little tablet.	20in Monitor
has all of the functions of the expensive ipads and works great for fraction of the cost!	ThinkPad Laptop
after looking at several similar products, and looking at multiple reviews, the amazon fire hd 8 seemed like the best choice. the fact that it was onsale onethird off on black friday made the final choice easy. we are very pleased with how this product works and how it met our needs for a bit larger screen. easy for us midseventy yearolds to use.

i bought my fire hd just for reading. i have a kindle unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. this is an amazing little tablet. how amazon can sell these for only 89 is beyond me. and i got mine on black friday, so it was only 59! at that price it was a downright steal. i had the first kindle fire. this model is better in every way imaginable. i also own an ipad pro 9.7"". i don't try to compare the fire with the ipad, they are completely different devices. but for what the fire is, i love it every bit as much as i love my pro!

only cost me 59 at black friday. good deal. way cheaper than an ipad of which i have several. this was for my young kids. the only knock i have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. on apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. you only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i was pretty impressed with this little device. it was easy to setup and works rather well. i had also bought a ipad air 2 with 128gb during bf for 375. after playing around with the hd fire i returned the air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. i added a 64gb sd card and am downloading movies from netflix. the hd display is very clear. battery life could be a little better but overall i'm very satisfied with it. the free stuff you get with an amazon prime account is icing on the cake. i dig it!

this was a perfect gift for the holidays! i saw the reviews on this and immediately had to get it!	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this on black friday and i have been using it for about a month. it is faster than my fire 7 2015 most likely due to the 1.5gb vs 1gb ram. the screen resolution is fine though not the best. at this price i am not complaining. amazon adds some nice features as well. the advertisements are discreet and only when the fire is turned on. not a problem at all. even at full price this is a good deal.

we have one for each of my children so i bought this one for my mother. they are amazing tablets especially for the price!	Lightning Charging Cable
purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. it was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watchread while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.

so easy to use and can do so much more than just read on it	Lightning Charging Cable
i received this as a gift after my original kindle fire started giving me trouble after 4 12 years and wouldn't hold a charge. this new kindle fire 8 is fantastic! the larger size makes it easier to read. the ""buttons"" are better than the old one. i like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. it's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. the battery lasts for days! i definitely recommend this.

bought for college student as substitute for text books. works great!	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a christmas gift for my granddaughter. i purchased this one because i heard a lot of good things about it and the price was great on black friday.	USB-C Charging Cable
got a great deal on black friday. this is the best affordable tablet for under 100. was able to get advertisements off from amazon and installed playstore. wife bought a cheaper cover for this tablet. love the amazon environment. want to buy another one if they come down in price again!	Apple Airpods Headphones
my two oldest 10 almost 8 love these tablets and i love the freetime subscription from amazon!	iPhone
my aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. she does not have internet at her house. but she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new kindle.	Flatscreen TV
if you are in the amazon ecosystem, the fire hd8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. the only drawback of the fire is the apps are only available from the amazon app store, not the google play store. for example, there is no gmail application to install. but that's not what i use this for. kindle reading, netflix viewing, occasional facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. can't beat it for 89.	Lightning Charging Cable
my whole family uses these tablets. we love them and with prime it is awesome.	Lightning Charging Cable
i like this tablet it's easy to use easy for the kids	iPhone
it works just right. my husband loves it too. it does well with my kids.	Lightning Charging Cable

got everything on here and then some!	Wired Headphones
my kids have the older model fire, smaller version. they can spend hours on it. this is bigger, better version with a larger screen size. each child is getting a different color so they know whose is which.	Wired Headphones
durable, works great enjoy using it for books and audio books	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i previously owned a samsung tab3. as a media device for reading, viewing, listening, playing, the hd8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation. however, the proprietary nature of amazon's apps basically eliminates for me using it for work email, document spreadsheet storageretrievalediting. since i didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but i think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users. at some point i will probably spring for a moreexpensive updated samsung tablet or windows surface, if i'm feeling reckless, and the hd8 will probably be passed on to my 9yearold.	Lightning Charging Cable
i am so impressed with this tablet. my seven year old loves its app, gaming and ereader functions.	Wired Headphones
easy to use reading device. looking forward to watching movies on it. great value	34in Ultrawide Monitor
my girl loved it, she loves that its linked to echo	Apple Airpods Headphones

great kindle, my wife had the originally one and this one is better in every way.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i purchased this tablet on thanksgiving day when i was already in the store buying a new cell phone. it was on sale 59. i am very pleased with my purchase. i am already an amazon prime member so it links up to my account. i am very happy with my purchase and recommended to my brother who bought the same day i did	USB-C Charging Cable
i really like the fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. there is no google play so you can only download apps chosen by amazon at their appstore. otherwise, pretty cool for the money.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this for my birthday and i love it. i love the resolution, size and blue light setting. i am now thinking on buying one for my four year old nephew as a christmas present, i only need to buy a sleeve.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. he will enjoy it for hours.	Google Phone
clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and i like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv.	Flatscreen TV
i need a table that had more memory to start with. this fit the bill. i had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . this make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone.	Lightning Charging Cable
pros 5 ghz wifi, supports expansion cardscons app store a little limited though there is apparently a workaround other the ads fed from amazon are not terribly intrusiveoverall, the tablet seems to work well and is a good value,	USB-C Charging Cable
this item is perfect for online reading and internet browsing. the only con is that amazon doesn't have some of the apps that google play has.	Wired Headphones
the camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one .	ThinkPad Laptop

for the most part i like the tablet. got it for my mother. the con is you have to use amazon for apps.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

it's very good product and i recommended this to buy it.	Lightning Charging Cable
best bang for your buck.	Lightning Charging Cable
excellent pick up during the black friday sales. not too big not to small. this tablet bundled up with amazon prime service is a great combo of inexpensive entertainment.	Wired Headphones
i had a very small nano and needed to have more space for songs that are just coming out and so far i love it. didn't really need the bigger one because i have a phone that will do most of those things.	Wired Headphones
works very well for light tablet use and great for reading.	ThinkPad Laptop
fire 8 hd 2016 is great. very easy to maneuver. easy to use and transition from original kindle fire. much more versatile than the original. really glad i upgraded.	Lightning Charging Cable
ok tablet from amazon, added google play to device for more apps. google how to do this.	USB-C Charging Cable

i had a kindle for about 4 years, i've been wanting a fire hd for sometimes, because of all the features. i can honestly say that i love my fire hd.	Wired Headphones
still playing with it, figuring out what i can can't do. i love the tangerine color i got. one thing for sure, some apps i have on my phone like redbox instagram they are not in the amazon app store so i can't put them on the tablet. wish i could.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
working great as a first tablet for my grandson. he loves it	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
very fast tablet. large screen but can held by 1 hand. great for movies and videos, as well as candy crush and other resource hogging apps. it starts cc way faster than my lg g3 phone. the display is very clear and crisp. the amazon android modified os is good once you get used to it. i have one screen containing all apps, and you can put these in groups too. so 1 screen is all you will need. then you have the other panels for amazon mandated stuff like prime movies, music, pictures. it's pretty cool compared to my previous acer 8"" tablet with reg android. could not easily install chrome, but i'm getting use to the silk browser and it will work very well for my needs. great tablet and highly recommended.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
definitely an amazing deal at an amazing price on black friday weekend	AA Batteries (4-pack)
amazing product from amazon within budget and get the best outcome of it	AA Batteries (4-pack)

good product i would recommend it to everyone thank you	Wired Headphones
thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this on black friday for 60 bucks and wasn't expecting too much at that price point. this isn't as good as a ipad but at that price it's pretty close and worth every penny.	Apple Airpods Headphones
bought this for a christmas gift. have heard good things about them and it was a recommended buy.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

it's easy to use. i can check my email, play games from appstore, headlines news, amazon deals offers. very reasonable price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased this for my grandson. it works great and is used mainly for reading and games. easy to setup with no problems to register and get online.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. i went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so i got the 16 and a memory card that i will probably never need!	Apple Airpods Headphones
love it fast , pictures look fab. love the battery life	USB-C Charging Cable
fast, easy to use, very sensitive, google play store captable, i will buy again	Apple Airpods Headphones
great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. these are email, web surfing, and social media. if you belong to amazon prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. movies, tv shows, music, books. a lot of this is free for prime members. good idea and business move for amazon as it encourages amazon content and purchases. the tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an ipad. easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. if the ipad is setting the bar and is a 10, i would give this an 78. the weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. a feature it has that the ipad lacks is the ability to add an micro sd card for extra space. it is also much cheaper than an ipad.	Vareebadd Phone
i bought this for my 7 year old when her samsung tablet stopped charging. i love the design. only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. other than that, great for the price.	Google Phone
fire tablets never disappoints! great price, used my certificate points which helpedalways best price at best but	Apple Airpods Headphones
most of the kindles i have purchased have been gifts, but this one was for me. it is just what i expected from the reviews. great tablet for the money.	Google Phone
very good product in its price range affordable and very good	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the tablet works fine. but speakers are not that great if you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
for the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i love the light weight for the size! fun tablet!	Wired Headphones
i really wanted to give this device a chance but i did end up returning it. it's a huge upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. honestly i don't think anyone should purchase that. if your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the amazon ecosystem i.e. prime member this will make a great tablet. i think it is intended more for kids though than adults. having ipads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the amazon os just were not worth the hassle. will end up seeking out a used ipad mini 2 instead of this.	Wired Headphones
inexpensive tablet. funtional and great for reading. it has the blue screen that make it great for reading.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great graphics for price compared to other brands.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased for my nephew for christmas. i know he will enjoy it. after i read the reviews there are a variety of things he can do on it for a 13 year old.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
purchased this for my nephew for christmas. after reading reviews, i think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music.	Apple Airpods Headphones
upgraded from a6"" inch fire hd. for 89.00 i don't think you can find a better tablet value. resolution is very sharp, audio is good, and it is a good size.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my first tablet and it is just perfect for a beginner like me. easy to use and just the right size. i use it when i just need to check something quickly on the internet without having to turn on my desk top computer. very fast.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great tablet for a great price and size. would highly recommend !	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great over all tablet! good build quality, but cheap enough for the kids to use loose. really a plus for travel. install vlc media player from the amazon app store, and then you have unlimited movie options for up to12 hours. add some head phones and that 6 hour trip to disneyland, well it's so much more tranquil for the adults.	Vareebadd Phone
the screen is a good size portable but large enough to read and has excellent resolution and color quality, the wireless connection is good and the user interface is relatively clear and easy to learn.	Wired Headphones
bought two of these for my grandson and grand daughter and they love them. i like the parental controls and the apps.	Google Phone
perfect device for my kids. easy to use with lots of features.	Wired Headphones
we had a few other tablets for my wife and all were very poor. we returned two and landed on this one, she has loved it, so much more than the others in this price range.	LG Washing Machine
i have had two previous kindles since they where first available. i really like all the new upgrades. the screen is very crisp and clean. the color is great. much easier to look for books.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this tablet is great! nice display, and you get the amazon ecosystem. now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds.	27in FHD Monitor
i was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the amazon fire i was convinced that i had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. i was concerned that i had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and i really like the screen size. it was a great buy!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
for the low price it is very speedy and has sufficient storage space.while it doesn't have google play, the amazon app store has most of the same apps or a workable alternatve.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
we are really pleased with this tablet. the color is great.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
at this price point it is very good. but having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. amazon app store lacks content. overall good for my 9 yr old.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a great tablet! i absolutely would recommend it to a friend! i would buy it again!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the tablet works good. good price point . would buy again	Apple Airpods Headphones
i enjoy readi,g and facebook using this item. i also purchased my husband one.	Google Phone
i love my fire! does all that i need it to and more! however only four stars because i can't get rid of the ads on my lock screen unless i pay 15. it does have a lot of glare but i don't mind the glare too much! speed is great lots of storage!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch youtube , and in general good enough for the price!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it works great for all my needs to check my emails	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
a little more space on outer edges would be great. i only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. at times it kicks me out of the game popular game from ew otherwise great for what i do. needs more security. but overall good purchase for less than 100.	Flatscreen TV
for the price you really can't beat this tablet. the picture looks good, amazon has a great game, movie and music catalog. so if your looks big for something just to view movies on, play games or surf the web get this one because for the price it can't be beat!	Wired Headphones
brought it for my son does exactly what i want it to do.	Apple Airpods Headphones
bought this as a replacement for the 7"", faster and better display. best upgrade	Lightning Charging Cable
i wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. i was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle ereaders. i liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. i decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, i can do many other things with it for a cheaper price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
love it i got it for my kids its more durable than a apple table	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i love the product. i'm very happy but i would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case i wanted to refer back to a certain page.	iPhone
upgraded my 3 year old kindle same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.	Google Phone
i have been a kindle fire user for years. this new one is amazing. i like being able to store information on a sd card.	Wired Headphones
we like the battery endurance. the new 8"" screen is great too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i am very happy with this tablet. it's a good size for me and easy to read and use.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the wifi would drop often to where i could not listen to spotify or other services without buffering.	20in Monitor
i was contemplating to buy either the insignia 10.1 or the fire hd8, i'm so glad i chose the latter. it is so fast and sufficient for my needs. i also downloaded google play on the tablet even making this a better purchase. for 59, you can't go wrong with this purchase.	27in FHD Monitor
its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to ipad. app is somewhat limited unless you side load it.	USB-C Charging Cable
went in to look at the 10' kindle fire and couldn't resist the price on this one. there wasn't a big enough size difference to justify spending more than 200.00 for the 10 inch. this has been a great device so far. battery life, ease of use, etc	USB-C Charging Cable
i had to return my device due to wifi signal dropping, maybe i just had a bad unit.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this for my dad as a birthday present. i opened it and set it up for him and it works great. it's fast enough for an internet browser, and possibly a student.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i have been wanting to purchase a tablet for light web browsing, reading, and to watch videos, something easier to carry than my laptop. this tablet is fast the videos stream in great as long as you have good wifi connection. easy access to amazon too.	Apple Airpods Headphones
first, i would like to say i own ipads, iphone, and many things apple. second, i also own many android devices. the main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes amazon prime. over all i would purchase this over an ipad mini any day just for the value alone. at first i thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my ipad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. however, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. the ""ondeck"" is a great feature, but i would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. a better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies willynilly. be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. ok on to kindle for reading. unfortunately, reading isn't as great as i thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. if you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. one last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""amazon store"" as in the google play store. i know this because i have an nexus phone and compared them. for example, the hue app doesn't even work from amazon store. anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions.	iPhone
bought this for my father who would have trouble using a computer. he's picking up on it very quickly. it keeps him entertained. good reliable device.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need	Wired Headphones
this is a great tablet for kids and adults alike.!	Wired Headphones
got this for my 3 year old and 7 year old and they love it. i have education apps and books that reads to them or they can read along. i would recommend getting a case for it if it's for the little ones just to keep it protected.	27in FHD Monitor
impulse purchase but a good one. good fit with amazon account that we already had. nice screen, easy to navigate	USB-C Charging Cable
this gift was for my mother in law. initially i had to help her set it up, but she loves it and can now program it all by herself. recommeneded!	USB-C Charging Cable
for its price, this a great little tablet. it does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason i gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. hopefully amazon will allow it to perform better soon.	Wired Headphones
this suited my exact needs which was a mobile way of watching netflix.	ThinkPad Laptop
i thoroughly enjoy this table! easy to operate, plenty of memory, and i can use it for anything that i typically use a computer for.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
great for airline flights, viewing offline amazon or netflix shows and reading books. video quality fine for personal viewing.	Wired Headphones
it has been one of the best purchases ever. it is very simple to use.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is my first android tablet. it works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an ipad. the ads are extremely annoying, but that's not best buy's fault.	USB-C Charging Cable
for me this tablet is an extremely good value! ipads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. but they are expensive! same thing with android tablets. you can get a cheap android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet.poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. i think amazon hit the spot with their line of fire tablets this hd8 in particular. it's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. also being an android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing google play for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done. much more flexibility than you get with an apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard samsung etc. coming from using apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. not only that, it's genuinely a good product!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
the tablet works great so far. the parent features are nice also.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
suggested by the sales associate i'm glad i took his suggestion	USB-C Charging Cable

purchased the amazon fide hd8 as a gift for my dad, who has been overjoyed with it. the display looks great and it offers him access to many of the features he looks for in a tablet, from ebooks, streaming video or online shopping. the price is low because amazon's os is restrictive, but for simple or specific needs, this product is great.

i like this tablet. i had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. the downside? the amazon fire is so ridiculously proprietary that i cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. this is becoming industry standard. too bad.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i installed a driver for google play store also i payed amazon to get rid of the lock screen ads 15. it was worth it. i use this thing alot.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

the tablet is good for games like solitaire or other app games, and of course for books. but for internet or other applications, it would not be the top choice. good buy for the money.	Google Phone
my wife reads a ton, she uses it everyday. she's owned others and this is by far the best.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

purchased to replace the one i bought for my brother in august physical damage. this time, bought the extended warranty. no issues or claims so far!	USB-C Charging Cable
i think the amazon fire offer should include a standcover as standard. i enjoy mine a lot more since i was forced to purchase a standcover which holds the tablet. would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.	Apple Airpods Headphones
easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. the device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. i was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
we are a total apple family so i was a little hesitant to purchase this when our ipad stopped working. so glad we did because it's perfect and can't beat it for the price!	USB-C Charging Cable

i think i downloaded 6 new apps. i wait to surf the web. this thing is so slow to respond. my old refurbished ipad is better. i really only bought it to stream hulu and netflix. i'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but i guess you get what you pay for. i wanted inexpensive, i got it! don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics.

great for media consumption. screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. wifi connectivity is good. speakers sound poor but i didn't expect any better from an 80 tablet. have had this tablet since november and is still going strong. only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.

last got fire 7"" for my kids, with an amazon freetime subscription. these are very good for the price with two flaws the screen is good and much better than other android devices at 7"" but not great, and got the 8 mb version with i would not recommend in hindsight. because android's subpar management on sd cards, got these this year. it has a much better screen, not only larger but with better resolution, adequate speakers for its price, it's fast enough and overall more enjoyable to use. 16 gb is the minimum i'd recommend, even with sd cards because some apps just work better with internal storage, and some apps even stored in sd will still use some amount of internal storage.it also has alexa voice support.the main reason for these tablets in my case is the freetime subscription that has unlimited access to thousands of ageappropriate books, hundreds or thousand of free apps and heavily curved web access per age presets. amazon fire os has a decent support for multiuser and in particular kids accounts. my kids are 7 and 9. they spend a lot of time on games as expected but also read a good amount of books.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
as far as functionality it works well. i can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. the app store has a good variety off apps. it does not have as many as the itunes store, but there is plenty of variety. the reason i knock a star off is the constant ads. i know that this is an amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying.	27in FHD Monitor
i don't use much of the applications but it works for things i need.	20in Monitor
if your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you.	Vareebadd Phone

really wanted a tablet that was near the nexus 7, but didn't have too much bulk! i looked at the nvidia shield as well, and ended up settling on the fire hd. tremendous resolution, great battery life, and very easy to use. highly recommend to anyone that wants a portable tablet for reading, watching videosmovies, and gaming.	Flatscreen TV
the first tablet i bought was good at first until it stops charging. i went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. we tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2 and will stop. i brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. so far i don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that i bought together with the first tablet.

it's alright to browse the internet and watch videos.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i bought this for my niece for a christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.	Wired Headphones
my old kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a black friday deal from best buy. price was great. the only problem i had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. i took it back to best buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games i had played. the person at tech support suggested that i change the plug in ""brick"". he said that they have had problems with that. i can use the same plug that i use for my iphone and now it charges fine. glad that it was an easy fix.	Lightning Charging Cable
love the 8 inch hd tablet. great colors on screen. not cheaply built like some.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the best tablet you can get for under 100. i have used or own many tablets including ipad promini, samsung galaxy tab and nexus. they are popular highend tablets but easily cost over 300 or 400. i was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. battery performance is great it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. speakers are solid with two drivers. performance is decent although not as fastresponsive as highend tablets. i was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. however for its price, i cannot complain too much.	20in Monitor

purchased this on sale for my son. he and i use the tablet to watch movies, play games, read books, and browse the internet. it's great for the price we paid. if you're a fan of amazon, you automatically have apps for their services.the downside is you are not able to use google apps and the adds that appear from amazon when you turn the device on.	USB-C Charging Cable
really a nice item .works wonderfully .for the cost it's a bargain	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i had been thinking about getting a reader for a while but did not know which one i wanted. as i looked at and tried several, i thought the kindal fire was the one i wanted. after discussing the features of the product with a salesperson, i decided.that it was the reader i wanted. it has turned out to be just what i wanted.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great value for the money. however, the operating system is a bit clunky. constant notifications and messages to delete. some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. the reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my son after he broke his ipad, and i am so glad i did! it has unlimited games and books, which has made such a huge difference in his desire to read! love love this tablet!	Lightning Charging Cable
bought this during black friday for 60. while i'm skeptical at first, it turns out to be a solid tablet for everyday use. not to mentioned the great low price!	USB-C Charging Cable
i love the size of this tablet. i have an ipad and think i prefer this size. it's easy to carry and a great size for reading. got it for christmas and am loving it! i haven't tried to take any pictures yet and i didn't really purchase it for taking photos. i saw the reviews before purchasing and they were not good regarding photo quality. again, that was not my purpose so am not too concerned at this time.

screen is good . lack of google play kinda hurts but you will survive. the issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them. as they are part of the screen . so you have to kinda summons them which is a pain	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it's a good tablet for the value. downside is there's no google play store access. so you're limited to apps in the amazon app store.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is my first android tablet. i have used numerous apple ipad's though.the only thing i have been dissatisfied with is that there isn't an instagram app available but that doesn't have anything to do with amazon or kindle.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
got one for myself and one for my son. like the parental settings available. no more inappropriate youtube videos. fast, great screen and appreciate the blue light setting especially at night.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i purchased the hd 8 to use as a viewer for my pearl rearvision camera, which requires dual band wifi and blue tooth. i installed the programs got everything up and working beautifully. however i was so impressed with its features, performance, and ease of use, that i've added a 128 gb microsd card so i can download amazon videos for my grand kids to watch while we are on the road. the price was terrific as well, but comes with the cost of ""free"" ads when the you turn on the tablet. fyi the tablet mounts magnetically to the vent holder and is removed when not in use.

i previously owned the fire hd 7 and was excited about the hd 8. after getting the hd 8 and using it i started to notice how they were able to cut costs. the screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great for taking on trips. 16 gb, camera, computer	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the amazon fire hd8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. some may welcome the ads others not. overall this tablet is great. battery life is several days with very minimal usage. battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

best budget tablet out there. hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.	Lightning Charging Cable
the only regret i have is that the price went down the week after i purchased it. it is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.	20in Monitor
this tablet is replacing an older model and the updates are wonderful. i can handle most media on this tablet and the resolution is great. i like the change of the camera to the back of the kindle instead of the front screen now i can see what i'm aiming at! easy to use and can't beat the price.

our 11 year old daughter received this for christmas and she seems to love it so fay. does just enough to keep her entertained and i love the fact that she can easily access her books when she wants.	USB-C Charging Cable
i loved this tablet. i did! but i did not love that i was being sold ads every time i powered up! i loathe even more that i would have had to pay 15 to discontinue that feature. amazon if you want 105 dollars for the kindle fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. it is unbecoming of you! i returned this item pronto!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this isn't a high end tablet. don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. but for general use, for most people web surfing, light games like angry birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television it's an amazing value. the amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. it took a few minutes to get the google world onto the tablet. google play, google store, google this and that. the 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. she loves it!	Lightning Charging Cable
bought this for my father in law who is not tech savvy. the free ""may day"" feature is the best part i don't get called for tech support all of the time.	27in FHD Monitor

brought it as a gift for my wife and she loves it!	Wired Headphones
i was initially excited to get the kindle. i am extremely disappointed with all the ads. even more disappointed to find out that i could pay amazon more money to remove the ads. it's frustrating that best buy and more specifically amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? would this have changed my purchase? absolutely! i would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a samsung tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
kindle fire hd8 is an upgrade for me from kindle fire 7. it has many more features and is very easy to navigate.	Flatscreen TV
can't beat the quality and performance of this tablet for 60. i bought it to be my main link with my amazon prime. but used it last week instead to download direct tv app so i could use it to watch the fbs championship game. it worked great but it couldn't help my bama team win.	Wired Headphones

great tablet, sturdy, excellent screen quality. amazon has done a fantastic job of making their tablets user friendly. excellent for reading books or playing games. would highly recommend.	Macbook Pro Laptop
the screen is great on the fire hd 8. this tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. the only thing i don't like about the whole amazon experience is the advertisement. other than that, the tablet is nice.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the headphone jack restarts the tablet when you plug the headphone cord into it. that is why i am giving the product only 2 stars. otherwise, the screen is great.	Lightning Charging Cable
simple and objective this tablet is an excellent choice for adults and children.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is an intermediate size tablet that works very well for its designed purpose. the price was good and it has plenty of acc.	USB-C Charging Cable

i only use the kindle fire tablet for entertainment music, games and ebooks. it's a great basic tablet at a low price. the sd card i added allows me to save lots music and books. the tablet is rather slow in charging but once fully charged it holds up well.	iPhone
upgraded from 1st generation fire tablet. decided to go with 16gb tablet and there were none in store so i had to order for free delivery to store. arrived on day promised. was easy to sync new tablet with older tablet. very nice picture and video. great value.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

the built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. the tablet is pretty fast and responsive. however, amazon's operating system is horrible. i miss a lot of apps that i use in my apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as mint and netflix don't have download capability. also it won't work with my chromecast devices.

got it last black friday. was looking for a cheap decent tab. could've been better if there was a mirroring capability.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
was looking at some more expensive android tablets to replace a 3year old device and saw this one on sale. despite the relatively much lower price, i was originally very worried that the amazon app ecosystem was going to be sorely lacking compared to the full google play catalog. but it turns out that while it is missing some important apps not just games but productivity apps too, the more than adequate specs good enough screen, 1.5 gb of ram, decent processor are enough for 95 of what i need from a tablet. and if you can get it on sale, you can't go wrong. lastly, if you're deciding between the 7"" and this 8"" fire, splurge a little bit and get this one instead.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
amazon fire hd8 is great for browsing and reading. gps system not that great though.	ThinkPad Laptop
i was not told i had to belong to amazon. could not get it to work with my router. i had been wanting this tablet for some time and finally decided to purchase it. i am heart sick to have to return it. at one time working with the a general manager by the name of brenda on my problems, she was highly disrespectful , embarrassing to me i front of other customers and very rude. representing best buy to the people who actually pay her salary and taking all into account, i would fire her in a heart beat. i understand from other employees she is like this quite often. if you can't fire her maybe taking her off the floor where she has to deal with the public and putting her behind the scenes would benefit best buy more than you know. 01162017. thank you.	ThinkPad Laptop
this is the best thing for reading specially on the go.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
now i want one. my older son wants one to. keep of the good work.	Apple Airpods Headphones

the amazon fire hd is easy to use. the 8"" tablet is just the right size.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
sharp screen that's not too big or small. takes some getting used to if you normally use an iphone. be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price. slim profile, just heavy enough to feel substantial and high quality. hard to find cases at physical stores.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my friend is enjoying getting acquainted with her first ever electronic device. it is just what she needed to get into the digital age. she is an older woman and is excited about all she can do on her kindlefire.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i was not sure what to expect from this little tablet at such a low price but i am impressed! the 8 inch version is a good size and a lot easier to carry around than my heavier 10 inch tablet. i read negative reviews about the video quality but i have not had any issues and use it to watch netflix regularly with very clear and uninterrupted quality. the amazon app store is definitely limited but with an android based system, it is very easy to install the google play store without having to root your device and voiding the warranty.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this was a gift for my wife and she has truly enjoyed it. the different lighting for reading so helpful.	Apple Airpods Headphones
very user friendly. for the price best deal out there.	ThinkPad Laptop
bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. she loves it!	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a very solid device for under 100. the screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. i needed more power to run some very intense apps, like litchi for controlling a dji mavic. so if you are looking for a powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3gb ram.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
amazon is great tablet and the price is excellent great	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

great products as usual and great customer service	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very functional for a tablet and ereader. this was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous kindle. she likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. the kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like youtube and youtube kids will not play on this because it's an amazon operating system. overall i would recommend this to people who like the regular ereaders and want a tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
it helps if your an amazon prime member . you can download a lot more things to do on the tablet	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this was purchased as a gift for an avid reader and as a streaming media device. i looked at the bigger kindle but this one is the right compromise between size and portability for the planned uses.	Macbook Pro Laptop

loved the product. first i was disappointed that i could not download google store apps but a quick google search fixed that issue and now i can download any google store apps. the battery life is amazing as i was able to watch around 4 full movies on a single charge. performance is great as games like marvel champions modern strike online had no issues. able to add an sd card is just perfect as i dont have to worry about storage for downloading movies or apps. speakers are better then my samsung galaxy s7. for the price point of this tablet there is not a single thing to complain. if i have to brightness of the screen can be better.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
gifted this to my mom primarily for reading books. able to check out ebooks from our local library. works great. she also uses this for skype, emails and facebook. her grand kids also use it downloaded few games and play. bought this during black friday sale and was an even better deal. it is a good tablet.

if you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfingshoppingetc., i don't know that you can get a better deal. however, that is about all you can do. we found out the hard way that the fire which we bought to replace a misplaced ipad, so maybe we were just spoiled is pretty limited in terms of the apps you can download. forget about any google based apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the android or apple market place. i love amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product i got for the price i paid, i just won't be going the cheap route in the future. hindsight being 2020, i should have spent the money to just get a new ipad since that is what we were used to.	Wired Headphones
got this for my 10 year old son. great for reading books and playing games. can't beat the price.	Lightning Charging Cable

i bought this for my mother because her nook wasn't working any more. although it took her a little while to adjust to the new device, she really enjoys it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i wanted a tablet that was a decent screen size, that could play games, that could stream movies netflix, prime, that could check emails, that could skype, etc. all while remaining affordable under 100. i have yet to see a tablet in this price range that can do all these things effortlessly, while remaining this affordable. this tablet has handled whatever i throw at it, and with no hiccups. i had the cheaper 50 fire tablet prior to this one, and that thing was slow to process the most basic tasks. if you're looking for an affordable tablet that can do what a more expensive tablet can do, then pick this one up.	Lightning Charging Cable

bought this for my wife for christmas a perfect gift, if i do say so myself, and seeing the joy that it brings her on a near daily basis makes me want one for myself. alas, it will be another six years in the sequin mines outside nashville until i can save enough to get another one. but someday.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased this during the black friday sale. i'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1. the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. i can't figure out if i'm having issue with the colors or something else.2. the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience.	Google Phone
for the price this tablet is an absolute steal! i've never had an ipad to compare it to but that's only because i've never wanted to spend hundreds of dollars for a tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i love this kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. i would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear. love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.	Apple Airpods Headphones

if adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. also, there are too many adds. i returned this product.	Wired Headphones

most of the time i use the tablet for the web, reading and email, but when i want to work on a word doc, pdf, budget and a lot more, i can do it well on the tablet without pulling out my laptop. the screen isn't as sharp as the s2 models but is nice enough and it does not lack anything else.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was bought primarily for photos. i added the 128 card. putting in the 128 card might have been a little tricky but the sales rep did it for me. my wildlife photos look brilliant on the tablet. i'd recommend making a geek squad appt for about an hour after you plan to buy the tablet. that way you learn how to use it before leaving the store. also i got one that had been returned but all the parts still had the plastic wrap on them. that made it 100 less and hence the ""great deal"" in the title. it may pay to ask about a return. i plan to take some of the free classes offered.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it was well worth the black friday price! the screen is so clear, it is easy to handle especially for people with not so big hands, easy and fast when navigating.	USB-C Charging Cable

i had an apple mini ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version os i was told. i bought the fire to replace it since i mostly use it for gaming through my wifi. it was way cheaper and does everything i wanted and is very fast. no issues waiting for uploads. it has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and i have started to use alexa and that is great.

we originally owned an original kindle but it was slow app store was not the best and overall interface was to be desired. in fact eventually the device crashed and couldn't be recovered with limited use. deeply debated about getting another and actually bought a samsung tablet, but it was too small. this was such a good deal it was hard to ignore and have been very happy to give another try. this device is a great size and much better interface. would buy again and will consider in the future for the kids.	27in FHD Monitor

the fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7"" model. first, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. it is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

easy to use, size is just right. easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse.	Wired Headphones
as a low priced 8"" tablet, it has a good display, good speed, and reasonable battery life.i am a bit peeved by the rather intrusive adds that amazon pushes onto it.i am also unhappy that i cannot load all the apps i am used to using on my android phone. overall, i wish i had spent more for a real android device rather than having this with the amazon limited version of android.	20in Monitor
this tablet was a gift to my daughter because she's an avid reader and anime watcher. she has been nothing but excited since she opened it and there have been zero complaints.	Lightning Charging Cable

my hulu plays perfectly.great volume. kindle starts right up so i'm able to read fine. however, when i'm on facebook and click on an article to read, it goes to the page, and within 30 seconds, the page closes. sometimes facebook app won't even load. i find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. i haven't dropped it so i'm assuming this is an internal problem i have tried playing a couple games and it will say that i need ""the amazon app"" where i go to purchase stuff, which i already have.then it closes out saying error. i wish i could replace for a new one.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
nice size screen, clear and clean picture with plenty of storage	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought two of these kindles. one for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. however, my senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. as a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. however, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already.	27in FHD Monitor

first of all, this is not an ipad or a more expensive android tablet, but it's a very good tablet for the money. i own an ipad pro and ipad air 2, yet this tablet has a place in my home. if you're buying for kids, i wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this. good screen, fast enough, and amazon's underground free apps are a huge plus.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this on super sale as an ereader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. i found it to be a great value for the price. it processes rapidly on the web through its amazon silk browser. streaming music also works well. the screen has nice resolution. it does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through amazon does not compare to google. i was unable to download a google play app, although g mail works like a champ. the camera does not produce decent images. i wouldn't bother with that function. all in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an ipad.

good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. it's limited to amazon so don't expect to do as much as an android or ipad. i like mine and will continue to use it. i recommend using one if you can before buying.	Lightning Charging Cable

i really like the bigger screen. these are great for traveling with children	Flatscreen TV
hadn't really checked into kindlestablets before. does more than i expected it too, tho now i'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to amazonrelated and approved stuff. the app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of android which means no flash also. but i'm mostly using it for reading, so i'm happy with it and would recommend it. the 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this was an upgrade purchase. my previous kindle was 4 years old. still working! this new version is so much faster and has a much better quality camera! love it for reading, netflix and online shopping!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
overall i am happy with my amazon fire 8 hd. it was easy to take and use on a recent trip, although the delta app doesn't work with it so that was a little frustrating. not crazy about seeing the ads that pop up, but for a purchase price of 65 sale, it's hard to complain. this is my first tablet and i find it to be the perfect size and easy to use. i would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a tablet and expects to use it for reading, surfing the web, playing games and as a lightweight device travel option. i am very happy with the look of the games and everything on the screen, i can see myself using it more at home now, although i will still use my laptop when i want a bigger screen. i bought it in the store they were out of cases, so i recommend buying a case that also acts as a stand. i found one on amazon that was inexpensive and came in an array of colors.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
purchased this as a child's tablet and i couldn't be happier! i was buying it thinking that it would be cutrate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. despite the low cost and unimpressive stats i have been very surprised by the quality. the screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controlschild profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers crush the built in speakers on my ipad air 2. the only drawbacks i have found so far are power related. the battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what i would consider normal use and the included charger typical usb type takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. i suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.i wish that i had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and i would have kept the second for my own use when on the road.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
gave this to my sisterinlaw for mother's day. its a great entry level tablet. she loves using it, especially for games.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

one of the fastest tablets i ever had. netflix and hulu works awesomely!	USB-C Charging Cable
i have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but i enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. i just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. the newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. i hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.

this is my third kindle fire. it is lightweight and unobtrusive. i use it mostly for reading however i have had no issues using it for web browsing or for playing games. overall a good little tablet for the price.	Flatscreen TV

i purchased this tablet for my motherinlaw and she loves it.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. thats what i didnt expect, it being my first tablet. amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. its so annoying. but its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. however its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. so ehhh 5050.

late gift for my grandson. he is very happy with it. easy for him 9yo .	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i'm not super thrilled with the proprietary os on this unit, but it does work okay and does what i need it to do. appearance is very nice, price is very good and i can't complain too much just wish it were easier or at least more obvious to port new apps onto it. for now, it helps me see things that are too small on my phone while i'm traveling. i'm a happy buyer.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

great tablet for a great price. no need to purchase an overpriced tablet for children	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i haven't had my fire long enough to have explored all it has to offer. i've downloaded a couple of audio books that sound great and are easy to install and play. not my way to watch movies or tv but the screen is nice. very clear and sharp. audio is just ok from the speakers, you'll want some nice head phones or buds for music or movies. i really like the fire 8, it seems like a lot of gadget for the money.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

the salesgirl was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out the right tablet for my needs. it works well as promised.	20in Monitor
good size screen and clarity for the money. seems fairly robust. the biggest problem is putting apps on it, at least free games. they do not have a great selection and when i put them on some of them require you turn on tracking so they can collect information or they won't let you play it	Apple Airpods Headphones

the product has a 90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. my tablet died within a month. i took it to best buy where they said they don't handle the warranty, went to amazon web site where they said go to the store where i bought the device. after much digging around amazon web site i found out who would help me. i gave it a one star and amazon helped me quick. we were able to get it going again, a manual would help. the device works again. i found the tablet to be very functional, i watch netflix, listen to spotify, watch youtube videos, it works great!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent product for what it does. spouse loves it!nough said!	Lightning Charging Cable

i bought this to replace a 3year old kindle fire 7"" hdx that i had just dropped on the floor. i sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research i picked this tablet. just to be on the safe side i got 16 additional gb of memory. i installed a couple of games none of them memory hogs and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. i can honestly say this is the slowest tablet i've ever had. just rotating the screen takes 710 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and god help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. since there are no other fire tablets available for whatever reason maybe they're being discontinued? i'll be replacing it with either an ipad or a galaxy tablet.

i thought long and hard about upgrading from my paperwhite, but decided to do so despite not beating able to actually see one in the store. i have owned a kindle since the second generation version. this is by far my favorite. the look and feel are amazing. i don't regret the purchase one bit as i have the disposable income to do so, but for most the paperwhite will more than suffice at a significantly smaller price point.

i own a kindle hdx 8.9 and wanted something small and portable. wow is all i can say when i got my hands on the kindle oasis thank you babes . the kindle oasis is very tiny, portable fits in about anything from a jeans back pockets to a very very small purse! the clarity of the screen is awesome. the touch of it works perfect! very different than my hdx but i highly recommend it! a little more pricey than the paperwhite but this one already comes with the case and a built in battery in the case so you are set for long time reading the price is fair since the others you would still have to buy a case for it! keep in mind the case for the oasis is leather and you can choose from black, brown and red red was my choice., which to me it's not red it's more of a wine red color it's beautiful! picture shows my kindle oasis in the middle of the iphone 7 plus left samsung s8 right so you can get an idea on the size. it's super cute! it's tinier than the kindle paperwhite!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
got me reading again! love the merlot cover. this one is the smallest of all the kindle products i believe, and that's a big reason i picked. also the lightest i believe. battery life is forever.two negative points are the amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text black background white text.those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.still highly recommended.	USB-C Charging Cable
easy to read books this way. enjoyable at night in the bedroom or outside in the afternoon.	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased the kindle oasis because i was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my ipad. so the portability is great. and of course, i went for the most expensive, because i wanted the extra battery life. and while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. i love the nonglare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. but the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. i have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the oasis to connect, this is very annoying. wouldn't be a big deal if i only read from this one device. but i read from another and picking up where i left off is a pain most times. non of my issues are really a big deal, but for 300 i don't feel like i should have any issues.	27in FHD Monitor

i started to buy the voyage but when i saw how close the price was to the oasis, i decided to go ahead and buy the oasis. so glad i did! i love the case and the physical buttons to turn the page. it is so lightweight and i love the option of the screen rotating wheni need to change hands. awesome device!

great item! would definitely recommend this item am still learning all the things about it.	Lightning Charging Cable
this product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. it's a lightweight, longlasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an ipad. it is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and i find myself renting kindle copies of books i already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience.	Apple Airpods Headphones
upgraded from my old kindle keyboard. i love the ability to adjust brightness and font. i have small hands and this is not too big to hold in one hand. i was able to change the page turning buttons for left handed use. the charging cover last a long time. i wish there were more colors to choose from.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is not an upgrade by any means! my three year old kindle outperformed oasis.battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak two pieces to keep up with unsnaps constantly amazon customer services promises it will resolved in an update	Lightning Charging Cable
its a great ereader but a little pricy. it has the same specs as the voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. the only difference between this and the voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter leds, and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. i've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. you would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. but then i don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. overall, it's the best ereader amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! voyage is still not a bad option though	20in Monitor

the new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when i first got my kindle oasis. after i used it for a while 5 hours, i felt the design was kind of make sense. when i hold it with one hand right hand, the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that i drop the kindle on my facewhen i was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage	20in Monitor
i've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a nobrainier to upgrade. the oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. after a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. i missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! the paper white and the voyage were great devices but i often accidentally changed pages if i accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. the oasis' buttons have removed that issue and i am delighted! the weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. the addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use i think it's pretty clear the coverbattery is there only to boost the very shortlived battery in the kindle itself. ""months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. the screen is clear and bright, i can't see any led issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs.	iPhone
i would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. for a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp.	Macbook Pro Laptop
very nice kindle with a great battery life. my old kindle was not able to upgrade so i got the new kindle and very pleased with the product. arrived as promised from bestbuy.com.	Flatscreen TV
this is a great device. it is ultra light, and a pleasure to use. it also has a very satisfying premium feel. the price, of course, is not worth it. unless you can afford it. there are cheaper models of the kindle with similar screen resolution.but if you can afford it, i highly recommend it.

th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which i prefer. the kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. i returned this item bc the cover is flimsy. and i was afraid i would drop it and break the kindle.	USB-C Charging Cable

as a previous several kindle device owner i read a lot of reviews, many of them put the voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. but, after reading the pros and cons of both i still decided the oasis was the direction i wanted to go, i could always return it and get the voyage after all if i didn't like it. it's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. the buttons improve the page turning experience, i see no dark areas on my screed from the led lights, it holds a great battery charge true not as good as my previous kindle, but i still generally get around 3 weeks between charges, and it looks absolutely beautiful. i am very happy with this purchases and am glad i purchased the oasis over the voyage. it's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough.	iPhone
new to ebooks and researched available ereaders and tablets. what i like best about the oasis is the weight lightest on the market, battery life measured in weeks not hours and the capability to use it in bright sunlight. recommend it for all.	27in FHD Monitor
i am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. this is by far the best one. it is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. can fit anywhere. holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.	Lightning Charging Cable
i read a lot and have loved my kindle paperwhite and used it all the time. i didn't think it could get any better! i read all about the kindle oasis and it sounded great but the price was freaking me out and i kept thinking i really didn't need it! well i finally talked myself into just trying it and after just taking it out of the box and holding it i was sold. it is so lightweight and so easy to hold and the screen is wonderful! the charging case is so convenient and so easy to take off and put on and it really looks nice. i never keep it on when i'm reading which keeps the kindle oasis light. i am so glad that i went for it and bought it. i want to read more than ever now. it is always in my purse. believe me, i am not made of money in the least but i am so glad that i purchased this. if you are an avid reader you will be too!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. not as full function as earlier kindels	USB-C Charging Cable
there's no doubt that this is the best kindle device available. the battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. so what are the cons you may ask.for one, the battery life depends on the provided case. it acts like a travel charger in a sense. why a con? well, it limits your customization options. and there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. so, you best be cautious with it.and two, the price obviously! but if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case.it may almost even out. but a 290350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.still would recommend to any fan of ereadersreading	Lightning Charging Cable
nice device. but only minimally better than the voyage.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
ve owned the kindle keyboard, 2nd generation paperwhite and now the oasis. i love the oasis very much. the ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. it is so light that is the biggest killer feature of the oasis. the 10 leds look fantastic and i love the return of page buttons. i've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. all in all, this is easily the best kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future kindles are measured against.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. the screen was already great on the voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. they didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but i don't think i'll miss it much as i was always wont to fiddle with it on the voyage anyway.but this device made me smile as soon as i held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why i spent the money to get this device.the other thing i was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.the cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the voyage origami case does. the only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.i still wish it was waterproof	Lightning Charging Cable
despite not being able to get one of these from amazon until late june due to apparent strong demand, best buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, april 27. well done best buy! having owned several previous kindles, including the most recent paperwhite model, i was unprepared for how small and light this new oasis model is reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. the oasis and its batterycharging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest paperwhite with no case. the oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. sizewise, the oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. in fact, the shape is so different from traditional kindle designs that i had to compare it next to my paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size they are. it's the first kindle i think i could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, for frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. the screen is the first frontlit kindle i've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the leds from any angle. no dark spots, no bright spots.just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. the ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. it's sharp and clear, better than any kindle i've used. the reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. after doing so, this is where the amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. it's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. the display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. you can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. the battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. it's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. the power button and charge port are located in the upper topright corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the paperwhite. i find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. the back surface of the reader not the case seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. you'd think that amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. it's a minor annoyance. lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other kindle models without ads, it's 310 vs. 139 for an adless paperwhite. is this a lot of money? perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then i personally think it's worth it. a lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. is it for everyone? probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on amazon's website. if you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look i'm definitely keeping mine!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the onoff button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.

kindle oasis is phenomenal. it is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when i travel, the booklike screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, i can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly. the color merlot is beautiful and i've had it for three months and traveled with it and there have been no damages. the battery life is so long i have only charged it three times since owning it and i read anywhere from 35 hours a day. completely user friendly.	Lightning Charging Cable
small, light, but comfortable to hold with either hand. if you keep it in airplane mode with medium lighting, the battery last for weeks. lovin' it so far.	Wired Headphones
would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. but it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. so light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. but, using the cover is comfortable as well. the leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but i let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. nice quality leather and i love the merlot color. the page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. i'm very happy with my oasis.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
almost feels like reading a book in a light comforting way. easy to carry around. great on eyes and reading is enjoyable	Wired Headphones
when they first announced the kindle oasis, i did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation kindle paperwhite. just as i felt when they announced the voyage.i read a lot, so my kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. i have never had an issue with battery life, i have only had it get really low a few times typically when i was traveling. so again, i originally did not see a lot of the value to the oasis.as the reviews for the oasis came out, i started to realize what i did not like about my paperwhite, and i began to have an interest in upgrading my paperwhite to the either the oasis or possibly the voyage. the main thing i noticed is that i took my paperwhite out of the amazon case quite a lot, especially when i was in a seated position. this slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. i had some other minor issues with my paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, i couldn't find an adjustment for the light that i preferred 5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than i needed. i decided to pass on the voyage because i really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.now that i have the oasis, i definitely think it was worth it for me. i really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the paperwhite. it provides the same reading experience, although i did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older paperwhite, which is a plus.the oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. when i was holding my paperwhite with my left hand, at times i would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.i have the black model because it was the only option available unless i was willing to wait a few more months. the build quality of the oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. the only concern i have is how well it will protect the kindle. i will update the review if i find this to be a problem.i loved my paperwhite, and i will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older kindle or buying one for the first time. it definitely is great and the better buy, but i am glad i decided to order the oasis. the reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.

i bought 2 and am returning them both. both had lighting issues. on the first one, one half of the screen had a whiteblue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. when i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. i returned it because i had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. my second one was worse. you could see little half moons going down one side. that one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.i found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. it was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. i'm a female with average sized hands.i think what i really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price i might try again.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
with the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. with the cover detached which is how i use it primarily, the oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. the ability to switch hands flip upside down means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. the battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but i tend to reconnect the cover at night i am assuming that helps to recharge the basic oasis battery. regardless, it was well worth replacing our older kindle readers with the newer oasis we bought two.

i debated buying the new kindle oasis, since i've owned every kindle since the first release. it was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet. it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read.	USB-C Charging Cable
even when im outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book im reading are still crystal clear. that alone makes the kindle oasis worth what it cost me.the kindle oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book i choose instantly opens, ready to be read.it is the perfect size and isnt heavy or bulky. i really do read for hours at a time. sometimes i pace the floor while i read. sometimes im on my elliptical machine when i read. and sometimes im sitting down. no matter what im doing, the kindle oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.when i receive a book that is in pdf, most of the time i can enlarge the words. if it wont allow me to enlarge the words, i can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. i am able to make notes on the book if needed, and i can highlight words andor passages.my merlot leather cover is attractive. when i flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.how to make the battery laston the kindle oasis page, it says that its dualbattery charging system delivers months of battery life. this was a huge thing for me. instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, i would be able to read for months without charging the kindle!is this how my oasis has performed? well, not so much. there are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your oasis to last for two months.first, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. that one is impossible for me. there are days that i am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they dont occur very often. my kindle goes everywhere with me, and i use just about every spare moment to read.second, the wireless needs to be turned off. that one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. the only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.third, this is based on your light setting at 10. that is way too low for me. i keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.i dont limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and i try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. my light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and i put my kindle to sleep the second im done reading. so how long does a single charge last me? ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if i had remembered to turn my wireless off. once i succeed in keeping my wireless off, i will let you know how long the charge lasts.now, i dont plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. i allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. i allow it to drain down to about 50 before i plug the cover and kindle into my computer to charge.the one thing that surprised me was that everything on the oasis is in black and white. for some reason, i thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. but since i bought the oasis to read books on, color isnt needed.special offers do appear on my screen but only when my kindle is going to sleep or waking up. they arent a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. you can pay a higher price so they wont appear on your kindle if you would rather not see them.i asked myself some questions once i had my kindle and knew just how it worked. if i had known before i bought my kindle oasis that the charge wouldnt last for months, would i still have bought it? yes, i would have. if i had known that everything would appear in black and white, would i still have bought it? yes, i would have.

this is my third kindle. the best differentiator is the form factor. definite improvement over the paperwhite. also like having the pageturn buttons back. case is very cool indeed. if you can get past the jump in price remember you're not having to buy the case separately, it's a quality product to have.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i was so looking forward to this that i bought it right when it popped up as available on best buy. this is obviously the most refined kindle on the market as of now. the ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.the charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. once the case is connected it starts charging the kindle which prolongs its battery life.in short, if you are an avid reader and can spare 290, this is the kindle to buy. for occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the kindle paperwhite should do just fine.	Wired Headphones
i have used kindle ereaders since amazon introduced them years ago. all are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade. the oasis is no exception, even from the highly touted voyage model. it is expensive but the lightweight design, improved backlighting and battery cover are worth the additional expense for someone who reads frequently. this is definitely a good investment!

this is my 4th kindle and is easily the best one i've ever had. it is very comfortable to hold and is very compact. i was surprised how small it is but has the same screen size as my other kindles. it may look costly at first but remember you are getting a cover with additional battery.

i woke up to a nice surprise this morning a new kindle as a gift. i have an ipad and a kindle dx, but i guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extendedreading on. don't get me wrong, i absolutely love my ipad and dx, but this new generation of kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. the ipad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. the dx was my goto device for those extendedoutdoor reading periods, but now i have a new friend for reading novels. instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. the ipad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the kindle falls short in those areas. the kindle works great for reading novels, where the ipad falls short. for those that love to do extendedreading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, i find that the dx is the goto device.br br without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. it's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. i've played around with the kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new kindle, i'm blown away. it's the absolute perfect size. smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. this is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. compared to other ereaders i've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.br br one of my biggest complaints about the previous generation kindles and the dx is the speed. it sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.read more	Apple Airpods Headphones

i recently ordered my 8th kindle. it was to replace my 7th kindle which i unknowingly crushed. i love the kindle keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. for me, newer is just more frustrating. however, new keyboard kindles are scarce on the ground, so i got a reconditioned one. i noticed on my account page that amazon recognized my new kindle as soon as i bought it. when it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home wifi. so i called my internet provider. i waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for english. that irritates me as i think english should be the default language in this country. but pressing on, i provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. then i listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem i was having. after all this, i was asked if i would provide feedback after the call. i know this company and i was sure i would have comments to make, so i pressed 1 for yes. then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers i had already provided. patiently i retyped all i had already typed. this time i was cannier. i refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. didnt i press 1 for english after struggling for several minutes i begged for a supervisor as i could not understand the english spoken by this person. i was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person i spoke to did not handle my problem. i asked for phone numbers every time so i could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. finally i found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my kindle and my wifi. i again asked for a telephone number in case i had further problems. im sorry. i do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. well, i should have known. i had been on the phone for 50 minutes.then my kindle would not download my archived items. so i contacted amazons help line. i got an american in the first minute. i did not have to press anything i explained my problem. the amazon american fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my kindle began working correctly. i was on the phone for 4 minutes.

i researched the purchase of a kindle for a long time. i couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated ereader. boy am i glad i made this purchase. the downside to amazon's online selling of kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. it is much better in person. this may sound stupid, but when i got my new kindle, i thought there was a stuckon overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. i actually tried to peel it off. doh! the eink on this unit is that good. i didn't realize that i was staring at the actual display. i also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. thus the great battery life i do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. the new kindle has been a godsend. now, i can decide the size of type i need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. the weight and ergonomics are very good. for someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. to me, it is easier to read than print books. the ease of navigation is great as is the speed. the battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. it easily connected to our home wifi, which by design does not broadcast an ssid. it downloads books so fast that i almost thought they were not completely received. i did not buy the 3g version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where i live. if you are not constantly traveling, i don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. for those who have no wifi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via usb.read more	27in FHD Monitor

i got my kindle a few years ago and barely used it. recently i discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. yesterday i opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.. a quick google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. not a chance though. despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative i spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. not sure it is worth the investment again thinking it is better to stick to reading on my ipad, which is equipped with indestructible gorilla glass. bottom line do not buy a kindle if you want a lasting product	USB-C Charging Cable

i've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the samsung line, but this is my first amazon fire, so i want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. at the time that this was written, alexa had not been added to the tablet.first, while this device runs an android type of operating system, amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. i don't feel like i'm using android. this feels different to me. it doesn't have the same level of customization that android users have come to appreciate. that being said, if you are an amazon prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. it's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.there are 3 onscreen buttons on the bottom of the device. the middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. the button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. it also lets me get rid of my keyboard when i don't need it on screen, but it's open. the button to the right is super important. it took me a couple of days to realize what it does. that square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. it lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. you can close them by pressing the ""x"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. if you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.the device has several menus that you swipe left to view. first, you start with your home screen. you literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. all of your apps are housed here. you swipe up to view all of them. the tablet comes with several apps preinstalled such as slik, amazon's own internet browser, audible, good reads, the amazon app store, a weather app, etc. you can go to the amazon app store to download other apps such as twitter, facebook, etc. you can combine the apps on this page into folders. you just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. this made my home screen much more manageable. you can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. this feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. i believe it only changes the font on your main screens.if you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" the device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the washington post. you'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.you can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. you can do this through the settings menu on the device. if you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into amazon's photos app, which is a cloudbased app.so far, i haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. i'm not crazy about the amazon photo app. i found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into amazon's cloud just so i could view them on my tablet. that being said, i'm not planning to take photos on this device. i just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. they are prearranged to be books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. all of those screens are connected to your amazon account. for example, if you have kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the books menu. your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. there doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. that bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. there's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. it's the ""recent"" page. it shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. i never use it, but it might be handy for some people.one of my favorite features of this tablet is amazon's ""on deck"" capability. if you're an amazon prime member, amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. the items don't count against your preinstalled memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. you can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. i've been content with the video playback capability. this isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is ok. i'll talk more about the speakers later. my other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the newstand. i've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. now, i can always have my magazines with me so if i'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, i always have them. one of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. i just had to connect my account to the device. this allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as i've had an account. my other magazine didn't include a digital edition so i canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. it was an inexpensive magazine, anyway. there are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. i did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.the kindle fire doesn't come with the google play store installed. you can side load it to the device without rooting it and breaking your warranty. you can google to find the instructions to do this. it's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. it probably took me 10 minutes. most of the apps i wanted were in the amazon store, but there were a handful that i had paid for through google play. the only way i could have them was to go back to access that store. they have worked fine so far. i despise the keyboard that amazon preinstalled on this device. there are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. i suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but i hate it. i fixed that problem by going to google play and downloading a new keyboard. it was a pretty easy problem to solve so i can't complain.apps that are connecting to the internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. if you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. the screen on this device isn't bad. if i compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.the speakers are ok. there are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. i won't say that they are fantastic. they aren't. in my opinion, they are fine for watching youtube or a television show. they are not ok for listening to music if you are an audiophile. you can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the preinstall app, but still your music will sound tinny. that being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.this device wasn't made for taking pictures. it has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. i'm not using them.i find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. i think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. also, i do have some hand problems similar to someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome. i think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. i'm still waiting for it. i'm greatly enjoying this device. it's simply fun to use the tablet. there are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use amazon services. if you don't typically use amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be ok for you.

i love my kindle fire. its a great reading device.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
easy to set up, great picture love it! keeps my kids entertained and they love it also .it was a gift.	iPhone
the last 2 models of kindle hdx 8 have been terrible. we have purchased 2 of each model of kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. the slot for the sd card is defective. i gave up and bought the newest model. it shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. it's going back after the first of the year. this is going to be my last year for kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. phooey!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
easy to use with great picture. i would recommend it to a friend.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this product was purchased for my grandson. he had a fire 6. he however loves the hd 8. he uses it for music gaming mostly. great electronic device.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this works great. i read a lot and i needed something that would handle all my ebooks. it has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but i use it for the ebooks and one game. excellent!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
so far the tablet has been working without any issues. haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the right device to play with puzzles, you can avoid samsungverizon constant advertisements. only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
my fire is compact and easy to use. mainly used to read online books at lunch time. the battery lasts much longer than previous tablet i had and charges much quicker. very happy with my fire.	Lightning Charging Cable
used it for watching television shows. the picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
only negative is the apps. thought they were from android but they're an amazon version and limited.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have really enjoyed my new kindle and the ability to take pictures. it stays charged a long time when i am reading a book or watching a movie. i just wish that kindles could run on an lte network as well when you do not have a wifi signal.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the clarity of the screen and the backlit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. i now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. i am enjoying my new kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. i would recommend getting help in the store to get you started.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i have had this for several weeks. it works great. i am very satisfied with it so far.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is my 3rd kindle upgrade. i love everything about it. the ebooks read to me at night, the games and the movies show extremely well.feels as though i am right there. my kids have ipads.but i'm stuck on my kindle.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
never without my amazon hd 8 great for reading, games and surfing the networks.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
awesome and best ebook reader. i love the smooth page translations, bedtime shade and perfect hand held device. kindle fire has took their e reader to the next level. great apps, music, and storage expansion for the price.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought this for a work fundraiser and the recipient enjoyed it	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i think this is a great product and i would recommend it.	Google Phone
it was a good deal for this unit. they even beat amazon.	Wired Headphones
bought it for the grandkids for christmas. like the parental controls!	USB-C Charging Cable
haven't had this long but so far so good. it's nice when you buy a product and it works exactly how it is supposed to.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i bought this for a daughter, who would be taking this to school for byod. it's perfect size table offers, loads of amazon goodies if you are prime member. for our need, it was good enough, but one of the requirement was to have google app support on this. since this runs fire os, it's everything amazon proprietary. there as ""howto"" on web on getting google play store and its app on this, but the integration with the device lacks upon those ""fixes"" from the articles on how to get google app store working on this tablet. since it would not be useful for her in school because of requirements for google apps, we're returning it. otherwise, great tablet, but fire os restricts google apps.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my adult son who had a long flight and he absolutely loved it! definitely recommend!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
so easy to use and navigate. easy easy amazon downloads from books to apps etc. i'm in the older generation that finds it hard to navigate electronics but not this tablet and best buy employees were great in helping me decide by giving a tutorial and info on the tablet .	Google Phone
fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once i added the google play storevery simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty. display is sharp and video and games load quickly. i deducted one star as amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
for the price this is an excellent tablet. i have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design i normally just use it in laptop mode. i also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. so i was not sure how often i'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. the fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days i use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. the speed is zippy the screen clarityquality is good enough. storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable for now i use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb. tying into amazon is nice since i have amazon prime. basic web surfing, email facebook work great. the only ""bad"" feature is the camera video quality. but that does not matter to me since i have my high quality camera video recorder on my phone. only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. colorbrightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up running. really enjoying the kindle component for book magazine reading as well. overall, probably the best 100 i have spent in a long time.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
larger size more.memory, better price great product and wonderful service	Macbook Pro Laptop
many improvements than the older model with an excellent screen and great battery life.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great for all your tablet needs! email, video, games, and reading! all in one!	Macbook Pro Laptop
my husband loves this. he is happy that he can read anything he chooses from his library and that he also has wifi access to get to his email and the internet whenever he wants.	iPhone
i was literally still using my first gen kindle fire and finally upgraded. i love the new one. the only negative is the speakers. my first one is louder than this one.	Wired Headphones
i have one, purchased this one for my mother in law, she had a 7 inch, between the bigger screen and hd, this one is much easier on her eyes and she can use it for longer periods of time without her eyes bothering her.	Wired Headphones
but, i can't figure out how to move books i've read, into the cloud? i don't like clutter, and the more i read and download, just clogs up.	Google Phone
it's great to some extent but i was expecting more. it's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. perhaps i'm not using them correctly. i'm still learning.	Wired Headphones
bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. she loves it. plays games, watches videos and listens to music.	Flatscreen TV
great memory,great movies,great reading, great games,do i have to say more	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is the third fire tablet i have bought. the larger size is nice.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. it does what i need and more but i just don't know how to use it yet.	ThinkPad Laptop
i talk myself into the 32g and i am so glad i did! i have used only kindles for the past 5 years and i love them. i love the color as well!	Lightning Charging Cable
the kindle over all is great. there's only one thing i would want better and that is the speaker. my last kindle was louder. i really miss the louder speaker.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this as a christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. it hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. i'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.	Lightning Charging Cable
purchased this as a gift for my wife because her bn nook was dying. she absolutely loves it, especially since it does so much more. i'm now waiting for my nook to start acting up so that i have an excuse to get a kindle for myself.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i would recommend anyone buy this product., just awesome.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
love my new kindle fire. this replaces my old one and is just as good. videos are as good as my tv with cable. well with every penny spent and better deal than when i tried amazon.	Apple Airpods Headphones
we replaced and aging fire hdx. she noticed the wifi connection is improved and the screen is larger. she prefers this to my ipad air	Apple Airpods Headphones
nice little tablet with great features. bought one for my mom so she can read without all the weight of a big book. she also loves the nice backlight so she can be on her tablet at night without the lights on.	Macbook Pro Laptop
wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. this works. saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.	20in Monitor
i was looking to upgrade from my old kindle reader and stumbled on the fire hd which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. fairly easy to use. i really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. i wish it supported all google play apps and not just amazon apps but i can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. but.when i want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting.	LG Washing Machine
in my opinion it's very slow for internet use. good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house.	Lightning Charging Cable
easy to use. nice sides and easy to read ,, also very easy to load	34in Ultrawide Monitor
had a prob with original one i purchased and bedt buy replaced it hassle free	iPhone
i would recommend the fire tablet to anyone. it is very easy to set up, download apps and use. movies are crisp and clear.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since i have a larger cell phone and a back up. used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when i sent my laptop in for repairs. so i probably used it a tot this week. i was watching my 3rd primetime video this week and it simply turned off. it will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. it is gone, it is toast. bought it october 11, 2016 , it quit on february 9, 2015. my old fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.sturdier built. this is full of junk, i am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. junk junk junk	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a very good tablet. the only con is you may have to reboot it too often.	USB-C Charging Cable
i hate amazon app store. nothing good in there. the tablet is too slow for what i do. it is good for reading only.	Wired Headphones
this is my second fire. wanted a larger size to make ebooks easier to read. very pleased with the size and clarity of this tablet. easy to take along in a tote. perfect for what i wanted it for.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
fixed alot of issues that were complained about with the 7"".	Wired Headphones
purchased this tablet for a gift.they love it. easy to use.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
video quality is very good. works well with amazon prime video and music no surprises there. apps are very disappointing many common apps are not available even though there are android versions! not bad if you have modest expectations.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use. very lightweight. would recommend to anyone	Wired Headphones
if you love amazon, you'll love the kindle hd8. it's a great size for reading all those books, streaming movies and tv shows, and has great sound for listening to your favorite music. for less than 100, you can't beat the versatility of this little device!	Lightning Charging Cable

holds a long charge. fast great space, no freezing or resetting.	iPhone
wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an ipad. the fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. the perfect inexpensive alternative to the ipad	Wired Headphones
this tablet is designed primarily to sell, distribute and store media purchased from the amazon.com product line, ie kindle ebooks, movies viewed or stored from their online movie streaming service, etc., and it does that very well.reasonably sharp screen, good sound, good battery life and decent component materials. it uses their version of the android os which they call the fire os which is decently responsive and fairly intuitive to use be aware that you cannot install or run most apps purchased from the google play store, but must rely on amazon's own app store which is decent, but not as extensive as either apple's or google's.	Wired Headphones
this has replaced my laptop for out and about. easy to use. in addition, i can now read e books and listen to audio books. so convenient.	USB-C Charging Cable
purchase was to replace fire hd 8.9 that was left on a plane found return 50 days later. like this smaller version due to size it's 3 years newer on the technology side.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my 2nd tablet and it works great with downloading	Apple Airpods Headphones
not to big, not to small. just right for for taking your movies and music on the go. i bought this to go with my amazon prime membership. popped in a 128 gb mini sd card for plenty of storage.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. it is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. it 'took over' and set up things with amazon i did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with prime before i could figure out the settings. the picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.	Wired Headphones
got this for my 8 year old granddaughter and she loves it. uses it for game play, homework, etc. mom and dad loves the parental controls. not having to worry so much.	Lightning Charging Cable

nice tablet for my 8 year old daughter! affordable! charging battery can be frustrating at time. normally have to hit power button to turn off and back on after you plug into outlet to charge or it will take many hours to charge. it is almost like it allows the tablet to reset to charge.	LG Dryer

works well.	iPhone
excellent product!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i don't think it's the adapter which seems to work fine. i just have to charge my new kindle lots more than the old one. it's probably the new kindle's problem but i'll charge it with my old power adapter just to see. i charged with my old adapter and it was the same as the new one. so go ahead and buy this adapter	27in FHD Monitor

i got this as part of a prime day kindle bundle, and it works just fine. however, there doesn't appear to be any difference between this charger and the 5 other ones i have, all of which were much cheaper. if it wasn't part of the bundle i purchased, i would have never purchased this by itself.	iPhone

this charger fried my kindle fire, samsung galaxy s6, and samsung galaxy j7. do not plug your other devices up to it! it easily comes detached from the fire tablet but does charge it. i'm just very unhappy that it killed my other devices. there are young children in my home and they know the difference between apple and android charging tips. so they will use any available charging cable they find when needed.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

does what you need, but because it has amazon's name on it, it's expensive	Bose SoundSport Headphones
works as advertised. however, i can't imagine why amazon doesn't include it with the kindle. i know of no other product that does not supply an item that is essential to its use. amazon should include this with the kindle. so, remember, add the price of one of these to the price of the kindle to get the real price of the kindle. that is why i gave it three stars. come on amazon, stop the misleading pricing on the kindle.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

if you plug the prongy side of the adapter into the wall, and then plug the big end of the usb cable into the nonprongy side, and then plug the little end of the usb cable into your kindle, it makes books magically appear on the screen. use your eyes to read the words, and your eyes will transmit the information into your brain.

it is affordable and it had increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very good reading on this good and strong quality kindle	Wired Headphones
i thought it would be as big as small paper but turn out to be just like my palm. i think it is too small to read on it. not very comfortable as regular kindle. would definitely recommend a paperwhite instead.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i particularly like the fact that the text shows up and you can see it well outside on a sunny day. i use it with kindle unlimited.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. it requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. the screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which i noticed less over time. the advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i purchased this product because i love to read and buying books got costly. with this product i can read all i want for 10.00 a month	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is really good if you read a lot, doesn't strain your eyes and very light weight. only demerit is cant use in night if there is not enough light.	27in FHD Monitor

the amazon kindle is a good gift for the bookworm in your life. the lightweight and simplistic operating system allows for easy and enjoyable reading without all of the extras of a tablet. great product for your money!	Apple Airpods Headphones
in trying to get my son to read more and thought a kindle would help. first i got a good deal on an old kindle model that had been refurbished and it quickly broke. i had a gift card to best buy and this one was on sale, so i got it for him. i also bought him a silicone case and bought a best buy warranty. it is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and i like that you can use freetime app on this device but you only just get the books. i also use overdrive to get him books from the library. so far it is working great for us. i bought this at best buy instead of getting it online from amazon because i like the best buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than amazon.

the kindle is great for reading on the go when i can't carry around a lot of books.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i bought the amazon kindle so i could enjoy reading without lugging around multiple books. i usually read my ebooks on the kindle app but i have gotten frustrated with my phonetablet going into sleep mode. this kindle is sufficient for my needs. i purchased a reading light for when i'm in lowlight situations and it works very well. i am satisfied with my purchase.

the amazon kindle is a great device to enjoy reading before bed. the device is small and lightweight which is better than holding onto a heavier tablet.	Google Phone
its a decent reader for beginners. there is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
super easy to use and very gentle on your eyes, i've tried many ereaders but i'll definitely stick to this one.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i love my new kindle. the size is perfect. it fits right in my purse. easy to navigate and i love the touch screen. i am able to read outside without a glare. only flaw is that it is not backlit, so in order to read in the dark i need a book light. i don't mind that so much, i just wish kindle would come out with a case for this kindle with a built in book light like they did for the first generation kindle.

it is great to be able to have all you books in the same place.	iPhone

great way to read books available for downloads from the library	USB-C Charging Cable
this kindle has no extra bells or whistles that would cause major battery drainage. sometimes less is more. no distractions to keep you from reading, no backlights to fatigue your eyes. be aware that you can't read this kindle in the dark.pretty simple to operate. fyi there is no wall plug adapter for this unit only the usb cord that plugs into the kindle, and computer for charging. you can buy an adapter separately. if you have the kindle fire hdx that adapter works with this kindle. you can use that adapter to charge it from the electrical outlet.i recently purchased this kindle. i do have had other kindles, and enjoy them immensely.i purchased this one for outdoor use.so far i love it!

there is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. i liked my paper white better but it died.	USB-C Charging Cable
after using a series of low end tablets as an ereader, i purchased this on sale for 50. it only really does one thing display kindle books in normal lighting, but it does it well.size, feel, and battery life are all good, and unlike lcdbased tablets it is easy to read outside. the amazon lockscreen ads are not that intrusive, and easy to ignore.

i replaced my kindle that i had for 4 years with the new one and after a short time was able to access all my books and continue reading the book that i was reading before i bought the new kindle. i am pleased with the new touch screen for moving to the next page, like that this one is smaller and easier to take in my purse. i did purchase a case and it is protective and durable. i will enjoy this kindle for years to come	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i am very pleased with this purchase. it is lightweight and the smaller size enables me to carry it easily. this kindle allows me to read out in the sun without any glare. the only suggested improvement would be a lighted display to enable reading at night.	Lightning Charging Cable

my wife had a kindle for 10 years and it finally died on her , this was a great replacement	USB-C Charging Cable
if you really want to have a good read on something digital this is the item you're looking for. it really is lightweight and highly functional. the battery lasts a long time and the screen is easy on the eyes. the only difficulty sometimes is reading in extremely bright environments. overall an excellent buy.

i bought this for my daughter, wanting to get her a kindle without having access to games like with the kindle fire. this latest version of the kindle is excellent. i am jealous of my daughter and now am thinking about upgrading from my older kindle. the touchscreen is responsive. if you like reading on the kindle, it is worth the update.

i like the contrast it is easy to read on outside.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i prefer the kindle to a book. i like the change of letter size, storing many, many books, and the ease of carrying it. i love to read when i travel, and this is the way to go.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this kindle for my wife because her kindle fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the fire. since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. the main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. all in all, it was money well spent.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
very easy to handle. many books to choose from and very convenient	Apple Airpods Headphones
i like the changes that have been made since my current 4 year old unit was purchased	Macbook Pro Laptop
i always wanted one of those, but they were too expensive compared to a tablet. but now i am loving it!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
used it and looks very paper like. they integrated the simplest form of an e reader, which makes it stand out for its use.	Wired Headphones
this is my second kindle and i love it! it's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. i just wish i could have bought accessories at best buy. also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to 'goggle' info on her phone.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a pretty cool little device. im able to download books through wireless and read them later at my convenience. only drawback is i wish it had more storage. but for the price, it works good.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

the screen is too dark, and cannot adjust the brightness	Macbook Pro Laptop
i've got this as a gift for my grandmother and she's not tech savvy but she can work a kindle. she loves to read and is very pleased with it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i haven't used any other kindle before, but this kindle was made to do its job and it does it properly. it is sleek, lightweight and sturdy. i love putting it in my bag and taking it with me wherever i go just in case i get a chance to read. like it says in the description, you can download books and read it anywhere you don't need wifi to read. battery life is great. it has a matted screen and you can make the font as big or as small as you want. the down side is that the screen is small, so you can only get through so much before you have to flip the screen. also there is no brightness controller for the screen so you can only read it where it's light. but i honestly love my kindle, it does it's job and i don't want anything that get's fancier than this.	Apple Airpods Headphones
item work well and was easy to read from in day light	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i really enjoy the basic amazon kindle and best buy had a great deal on it when i purchased it. it's very easy on the eyes and there is no glare when reading outside even on a sunny day just as advertised. it has the look of book in that sense. i was able to order this online and ""pick up in store"" and it was very convenient because i was low on time. i highly recommend this product to any avid reader and anyone looking to make the jump to an ereader. a few other great features are the long battery life, it's light and small and very easy to take on the go.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i love my kindle it makes it so much easier to read books instead of having to carry them with me	Lightning Charging Cable
the kindle is good to download apps for books catch up with reading	Apple Airpods Headphones
my first ereader, and i have been filling it up fast. great for travel!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
nothing bad to say about the kindle. i knew what i was getting when i got it, and it hasn't disappointed.	Lightning Charging Cable
bestbuy was offering some discounts during thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. i was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. but i must admit, i am not at all disappointed with this. works best with english books, does not work that well with native books. also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and i would deduct 1 star for that. you need to install another product called calibre in your computer to convert books to kindle readable format mobi. kindle can also read pdf, but mobi format is better readable compared to kindle.	iPhone
good ereader, with an improved design, lightweight	Apple Airpods Headphones
i already has an older version of the kindle, but this one is even better. i love the touch screen and the ability to scroll without buttons.	Apple Airpods Headphones
had problem with cutting off device. good easy read	Macbook Pro Laptop
this was purchased as a replacement for an aging third party ereader. it is light weight, compact, easy on the eyes while reading and has a long battery life. the kindle library has a wide variety of books, many of which are free. the one draw back for some people may be that the lockscreen has ads. this is only on the lockscreen, the ads don't appear while using the device and amazon can permanently remove the ads for a fee.	USB-C Charging Cable
it was easy to se up but the recipient wished it has an actual manual that you didn't have to download to print a copy. she has yet to use it outside due to weather at this time.	Wired Headphones
product is good, light. amazing battery backup. i charge the kindle one in 4 weeks. great product for reasonable price. usb connection is easy, books are easy to download. overall, everyone must have kindle with them and this is the best productmodel to start with.understandably, this is the beginner level model for people who never used kindle before. features like led lights, white paper background are not available on this model. these features are there on higher models so one cannot read it in dark without lights. but again, for this price you would not get any other good readers.if you are someone who reads in dark then i would suggest go for higher kindle models.	Lightning Charging Cable
good size for reading and screen is easy to read. even in sun light this was very easy to read and it fit into n small bag to carry around	Flatscreen TV
i'm an optimist, and i tend to give 5 star reviews more than anything. which i've had people make a comment about that. however, i cannot give a 5star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. that being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. i highly recommend.	27in FHD Monitor

i read a lot on the iphone and ipad which also have kindle apps that are good, but there is too much glare on their screens on a bright, sunny day this little kindle without a backlight is a nice solution to that problem. the recent sale price made it practical to get one, and i'm glad i did.	iPhone

i love how compact this kindle is, i'm able to put it in my gym bag, backpack, and my purse. the screen is a plain white which is great for reading because you don't get a glare, i just wish best buy offered a case for it i had to purchase one from amazon.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i love my kindle black. i can read for hours without making my eyes sore the way a phone screen would. the functions are easy to use. everything is set up clearly and simply. it's shape is adorable, and it's surprisingly light. the battery does last a long time.	USB-C Charging Cable

excellent base model ereader. nice to use inside or outside.	20in Monitor
i bought my kindle about 2 months ago and the battery is already dead and will not charge	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
for me, the kindle black was not a good fit for me. there are times i read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. this model doesn't have a back light so i'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.so i returned and went for a kindle fire.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's exactly what you'd think it would be. no more, no less.a perfect ereader for traveling and backpacking.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

it is just like reading a book only it's way more convenient! the background has the same look as the pages of a real book.	Lightning Charging Cable
love my kindle ! i enjoy reading everyday and i can easily throw in my bag with out it adding any weight .	Flatscreen TV
what can i say, if you enjoy books and magazines it's hard to beat. not backlit but not an issue for me. i take it everywhere and enjoy this version very much.	Lightning Charging Cable
this kindle is nice and my wife who is an avid reader likes the screen quality but truthfully does not like being ""pigeonholed"" by amazon for every book or story. having to go through them for nearly everything greatly declines from the ease of use of the various functions. the need to find or put her existing library into amazon in order to use it on the kindle is ridiculous and annoying. once again a another good product being sadly limited due to a monopoly.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i love the kindle, it is a great product. it reduces eye strain so i enjoy reading on it. this is my second kindle.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
if you are into reading then this is for you. i didn't think the paperwhite is necessary if you have a well lot room. great for reading outside.	Flatscreen TV
this is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i love how portable this kindle is. it fits right in my purse and makes it so i can read whenever and wherever i have free time.	Wired Headphones

when you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good product for child. who only need to read the books	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for my daughter. it is our 4th kindle bought within the family. the touchscreen is great and my daughter loves it. in fact, those of us with older model kindles are jealous.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money i would recommend the backlit model.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
love the simplicity. also love that i use it for reading only and can't download distracting apps.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use and navigate, purchasing books is fast and simple and i love the fact that i can password protect this device	Flatscreen TV
fought it for a long time, but kindle is awesome. the newer version with adjustable light is best for me.	Flatscreen TV
i liked my really old one a bit better. it broke after 5 years suddenly. the screen failed. i had to pay over 20 bucks extra to get rid of the ads to amazon. i wasn't aware of this when i first bought so it was more expensive than expected.	Wired Headphones
ok, i was so unsure of this kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. but i am very happy with it. i love my kindle! i have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce i got if for christmas. i have been reading the free books on kindle. there are so many to pick from. while home, i download the books that i want to read and then while i am in the car or waiting at the dmv, i just pull of the book and read. it remembers where i am in the book. this kindle does not have the back light. i was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. when i am reading in the car, i enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. that is the most important factor for me because i can get car sick if i read while riding in the car but with the larger font i don't have that problem. i wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because i can hold it up if i need to. the size is perfect! again, i can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability. love it!	Lightning Charging Cable
i just broke my 3rd generation kindle after many years, had to get a new one.the new kindle has more features in an intrusive format, it is hard to get books loaded, deleted, collected, and even to turn the page.an inadvertant tap on the wrong part of the page, or a twitchy finger, and you're down the rabbit hole.i really just want a reader, not another tablet	Lightning Charging Cable
my daughter loves her new kindle, now she can pick from hundreds of books.	Flatscreen TV
if you want to read anytime where there's a light source this is thereafter for you. if you do a lot of night reading the paper white is cheaper considering the add kns you will have to buy for the base model.	Apple Airpods Headphones
got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
overall good product, does what is advertised, comfortable to use.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this was my second kindle and i didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . what a difference. i took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white. this was not easy to read for me	34in Ultrawide Monitor
excellent lightweight way to take a lot of reading materials along when traveling.	iPhone
i used to prefer paper or hardback books but found i had more access to read online. with the kindle i have been able to access my growing library and the battery life is amazing.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i really enjoy reading and on my ipad was hurting my eyes. this kindle really works great.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i love this kindle! it's a life saver when i'm bored at the doctors office!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i liked t because its not harmful to my eye like the monitor or the mobile its the best choice for reading	AA Batteries (4-pack)
much sleeker and touch response is better. even wifi connection seems faster might be due to new processor and increase in ram	Lightning Charging Cable
very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. battery is great, visibility is great even though it's not a ""paperwhite"", and form factor is comfortable. special offers ads are totally noninvasive and i hardly notice anything especially since i use the reader with wifi turned off. sometimes i wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where i feel i'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i've been using a kindle almost exclusively and decided to give this one as a birthday present. very excited recipient!	Apple Airpods Headphones

i bought this for my mom. the type is adjustable and it has a backlight for easy reading !	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle ereaders are the best on the market. while this one doesn't include the built in light it is great for the beach and is still the lightest and smallest version.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
daughter loved this as a gift. she get migraines if she were to read ebooks on her normal tablet or phone the screen is dull like a book page which leave it easy on her eyes and fingers crossed no headaches	Apple Airpods Headphones
as always, great job! very easy to use and it's always with me. only problem i have is the button on the bottom is touchy, but not really an issue. keep up the good work	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this kindle paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. the display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. the kindle is durable, and although i bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. the most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. my son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use and has enough space. i highly recommend this product. also a great gift	Apple Airpods Headphones
i can download my pdf file and read in this kindle. i am satisfied with the performance.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
love my kindle, makes reading at night so easy and it feels like you are reading a real book.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is my second kindle. as i travel a lot, i love the ability to get electronic versions of books both through amazon and my local library.	27in FHD Monitor
the kindle is amazing. this is my second one. the price was misleading however as i had to pay something like another extra 30 bucks to get rid of the ads. just know that	Apple Airpods Headphones
first kindle debated between this one i got and the back lit version. very pleased it's compact easy to tote. using at the beech this week. i have amazon prime so i get free downloads on books . it is easy to use . i think i would definitely recommend this product to others.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
wasn't a fan of having to get one of these i'm kinda old school.i like book but, it really was a nice device. easy to use and read from. glad i got it!	Apple Airpods Headphones
update i bought both a fire hd and a gen 2. as a present to my mother in law my initial reviews were written after playing with them for like 20 minutes. i merged both reviews into one to really compare the two products. i'm still answering questions in the comments if you have any. and see the video that compares the two and gives a mini tour of the kindle system.my background i've had 4 android phones, i've had multiple ereaders and my latest 'touch' device is the le pan ii android tablet. i've worked on several ipads but never been compelled to spend the extra money for one myself. wife has a first generation fire.the new kindle fire and fire hd are the second generation color kindle ereadermedia playertablet devices. the original fire received a lot of well earned 4 star reviews. it was a great product but at the end of the day, it was a first generation product. it was no ipad slayer. the fire hd raises the bar and raises it quite a lot. jeff bezos said they set out to make the best tablet available period and in some regards they did that in spades. in other ways not so much. more on this below in the closing thoughtshardwarebuild quality both are top notch. i didn't expect anything less from amazon but they really are solid feeling. fire hd lighter and while it is about the same thickness, the edges are rounded more like an ipad. sleeker look and more comfortable to hold. fire gen 2 is heavier and 'boxier' built to more fit existing covers i guess. it's heavier too.sizingthe hd is just a bit taller but a decent bit wider than the fire. note pay attention to accessories because they are not the same size.read more	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i just received my kindle fire today. i had a hard time deciding between the hd, this, and the paperwhite. i decided on this one, because i really thought i'd like the immersion reading. i have an audible account and i've been reading along to the audiobooks. it's amazing how fast i can get through the books at 3x speed and i really retain the info. the immersion reading is supereasy to use and definitely worth upgrading to this. the whole point of the kindle is to read more, and this new feature makes it possible to read 2 or 3 times as many books in the same amount of time. i'm an averagespeed reader and was able to read 4 books with the help of the audiobook reading pace in the last 30 days and one was the 800 page stephen king, 112263.i also tested out the text to speech. it's a lady's voice and much, much, easier to understand than the text to speech on my kindle keyboard. it also has many speed options and i think it reads faster than my kindle keyboard version. i am very, very pleased with it.it is much more responsive than the previous kindle fire i'm upgrading from.if you are worried about the free offers, don't be. i detest commercials and advertising so much, i quit reading magazines and watching television. the offers only show on the startup, no big deal. i already took advantage of a 5.00 credit for amazon video. i was able to rent two movies and it only cost me 89 cents, when it was said and done, and i was planning on renting hunger games tonight, anyway. so, so far, i don't mind the offers at all.my favorite feature is the immersion reading and the texttospeech improvements. i also downloaded all the free kindle books with the free audiobooks for the immersion experience.read more	Flatscreen TV
i purchased the kindle fire ten months ago for my daughter. three weeks after she got it, it was stolen. amazon worked with our police department to find the person who had taken it. amazon first put a hold on the person's account and shut down the kindle fire so it wouldn't work. then, once amazon had a subpoena, amazon gave the police all the information the thief had registered to my daughter's kindle fire and the police were able to recover it and get it back to us. since that time, we have purchased an additional kindle fire and, just recently, a kindle fire hd. we use them like ipads at a fraction of the cost and the number of free books and apps available is unmatched by their competitors. our oldest kindle fire ten months old just stopped charging and i contacted amazon via live chat. immediately, they said they would send me a replacement kindle fire and would also email me a printing label for free shipping to return the defective one. their customer service is incredible! the kindle fire itself is amazing. the internet is fast connects perfectly to all wifi the graphics are clear and sharp the books and apps offered are endless. my teenager listens to pandora on it constantly. i'm always reading. my husband checks the sports scores. my young sons are always playing the game apps. we have them protected in klearkase protectors and have found them to be wellmade, quality devices. i wouldn't hesitate to recommend a kindle fire to anyone of my friends and family.	27in FHD Monitor
my 7 year old son has the 1st gen kindle fire, and we've been very happy with it. he mostly plays games on it now, but we plan to purchase more movies and books for it in the future. my 5 year old wanted one too, so we just purchased the 2nd gen kindle fire for her. she had been saving her allowance and birthday money this whole year for it. we purchased one the day they were announced!we've had it now for 3 days. and while it's still the same great product, we were disappointed to find after receiving the device that the 2nd generation fire comes without a wall charger which the first gen fire had and has a whole mess of ads loaded onto it. my 5 year old can't read very well yet she couldn't figure out how to get rid of the ads, and was constantly yelling for me to come help her. also, some of the ads featured more mature themes ads for sexy prime time tv shows, for example that i would not want to expose my young child to.to purchase the wall charger, it cost us an extra 20, and it cost us 15 to have the ads turned off. so now we're up to 194 for the kindle fire that we thought we were getting for 159, plus a whole bunch of time wasted trying to figure out how to turn off the ads, and waiting for the wall charger to arrive.i am normally a huge amazon fan, but this one leaves a bad taste in my mouth. would have given the device 45 stars on its own, but with the extra expenses and hassle, i have to take it down a couple stars.update oct 10, 2012 interesting that many folks have taken my review as an opportunity to comment on my parenting skills. while i'm sure folks are well intentioned sarcasm, i don't recall asking for parenting advice. many have said it's ridiculous to buy an ereader for a child who can't read.read more	Wired Headphones

i picked up this tablet when it was on sale. it wasn't a tablet meant for primary use and it is not an ipad. but for the price, the tablet is very powerful. with amazon prime i could do much more than i expected. my complaint is that the front facing camera zooms too much on your face. also, there is only so much that a single speaker can achieve. but it is definitely worth buying as a backup tablet.

i like the large display, it is very readable for this old man's eyes. the colors are vibrant and crisp. it plays videos well. i love the amazon underground absolutely free apps and games. the only drawback for me is the amazon modified android os. i'm slowly figuring it out. the cameras leave a lot to be desired, although they are not the reason i bought this. it is a bit heavy for me, but with a folio it is easier to hold. i also bought the tempered glass screen protector.	Wired Headphones

i got this as an upgrade for my old kindle i love the new features! crisp clear picture, easy to find app locations tabs. well organized. they added ""blue shade"" to adjust the color of the screen when reading at night because exposure to blue light is supposed to impede sleep. when reading it learns your pace gives you an estimate on when you will finish the book which i think is neat. can watch netflixhulu. all around great product in my opinion.

i was a bit worried that i wouldn't like the tablet. i had watched the prices go up and down on amazon. i wish i had bought one when they were 29.99. i also read all of the reviews and watched video reviews. i had a trip coming up that i didn't want to take my laptop on and took the plunge. i was glad that i did. i was able to watch netflix, hulu, hbo go hbo now and youtube with no problems. it is a great tablet for the price. i also have some books loaded to read later. i have been using my kindle touch for that. if you do buy this tablet i would suggest getting a memory card.

this tablet was a gift for my nephews and nieces to share ages 48. their eyes lit up as soon as they tore off the paper and saw the bright orange package. it was easy to set up and they were quickly downloading and installing their favorite games from the amazon app store. screen quality appears to be very good and processing speed is very quick! our only regret is that we didn't buy the 3pack so that they each could have their own instead of sharing! great performance value and much appreciated gift!	27in FHD Monitor

i got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. i had to wait about 3 weeks for the wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. after inserting the sd card from her other tablet i was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. it took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because i wasn't connected to wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. once i did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the lock screen. overall it's a good tablet, but i just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on amazon's paid services.	iPhone
my grand daughter has her educational apps on her tablet and enjoys them tremendously!	Lightning Charging Cable

i was amazed how little it cost to get a kindle fire these days. i passed down my ipad mini to my son because he uses it a lot and i just wanted something to watch netflix and read books. the big plus is the book lending library with our prime membership. it's noticibly slower than my old ipad, but for 50 i'm very happy with it.

the price on this is great. there are a couple of issues i have with my kindle but i think it's me not the device. sometimes when i shut it off i have to hold down the power button as the box that comes up that says ok or cancel does not work for me. the other problem i have is sometimes it does not go back to where i left off in a book. i took it to the store and the tech i had look at it did not have these problems. other that that i love it. i can travel with it instead of my bulky lap top and have access to my email, movies and books. i purchased a case for it that sets it up so i don't have to hold it and that made me like it even more.	27in FHD Monitor

i currently own 3 kindles, including this one, so i am very familiar with the kindle fire tablets. i love that this new fire has updated the look and feel. i can add a memory card to download books, movies, photos and games on so i can take them with me when i'm on the go and don't picture, which i love! so for 50, it's a great value. there are only 2 things that i wish this kindle had there is no sleepwake function and it doesn't have the micro hdmi port to connect it to my tv, but again, for the price it's a great product.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

kindle is good. i got one for my husband and sister. they are really enjoying them. it is easy to use for someone who never used one. my reason for not giving 5 stars was completely due to my best buy experience. i live in a small town and drove thirty miles to get to best buy only to find they were completely out. asked for help at service desk and they seemed put out by me.i wanted them to call another best buy to see if they had any.i was willing to hold them with a credit card in order to get them. they would not do that. i had to drive another 50 miles to pick one up. just thought best buy should have tried to be more accommodating, but it was christmas shopping season.

we bought 2 of these for our kids. first, i couldn't believe the price they were on sale for 35 but are normally still under 50. i was very leery of getting them 'tablets' because of all the things on the internet. but once i set them up i saw that the kindle fire has amazing parental controls. i can set the times they can play on them and how long they can use them even how long on specific things games, videos, web, etc. most importantly there is an option that allows them to be on the web but it's only kid stuff. i also love the fact that i have access to amazon on any device and can share things from it to both the kids' fire's. i can also check what they've been doing on them. they can only download things that i share. all these controls made me feel better about buying them and more confident that they are safe. there is something called freetime which i believe i have the free version but you can get a cheap subscription and it will give you access to thousands of free books. if you have kids, especially younger ones i would highly suggest the fire. also, the price is unbeatable, especially the way kids can damage things	Wired Headphones
purchased for an 8 year old grand daughter who loves to read. she loves this tablet and is reading and playing her games everywhere the family travels. she loves the device and the pink color i loved the price and the fast delivery .	Lightning Charging Cable

since today society is hitech savvy, it was only right to get this for my 4 yr old grandson. it's an awesome tablet!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we got this for my son foe christmas. loves it and keeps him entertained! it is user friendly for him for the most part and sturdy with the case it comes with. the only fault i see with this is in kids account. before you load anything on to it, there are already tons of apps available to download as you please. i wish there was a way to have just the apps you choose to show up. i do also wish that there was a way to lock the screen, or app that he is playing at the time so little fingers don't get off the app accidently, he is only almost 2 though so i cant complain too much. other than those two things my son loves it!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i love the kindle. my kids love playing their disney movies on it. they also have a ton of games we downloaded for free. i highly recommend!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
there is a lot of bang for you buck in this product. it is not up to par with apple pads and the high end samsung pads. check out the amazon app store to make sure the app you want to use is available. the screen is adequate, not hd, and outsidefull sun hard to read. the operating system is amazon's version of android. audio is adequate. wifi and bluetooth work well.

i brought these as christmas presents for my kids and so far no complaints.	Wired Headphones
to me, this is an amazing little device. i suppose it's not very fast by modern standards. downloads are heavily dependent on the speed of your internet connection and are slow and often unreliablemy home internet connection is not the greatest. but the screen. for its size, is beautiful. there are many games, apps, and books available for free. i love my kindle fire. it has wonderful, lean, fast apps for accessing email and facebook. the graphic on games amaze me. if you want a basic tablet for not a lot of money, i think this is a great choice. i'm considering getting one for my sister.	Lightning Charging Cable
this amazon tablet is, for the money, the best one on the market today. i purchased them for christmas gifts this year 2016 and when i saw them, grabbed 2 out of the 5 that were on display. i did so, because last year when i tried to get one, everybody was sold out ! not 1 to be had !

not the best tablet. decent image, but lackluster performance.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this because of the low price on black friday. my aging eyesight was making it difficult to read my original kindle. and, i have gotten spoiled by my other products with touch screen. thrilled i bought this because can see to read at night again and touch screen is nice. the light is not too bright, so does not cause headaches for me.

i purchased this tablet because it was extremely cheap. i'm not impressed with anything about it. it is slow, not at all user friendly, and the advertising is so very annoying. it is also almost totally useless as it does not support the few apps i use on a regular basis. i will keep it only to access my amazon accounts.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

overall the tablet is okay, i just paid 50 so can't complain anything about specs but the fact that you can't use google services sucks. no google, no youtube, gmail!	USB-C Charging Cable

if you want the combination of a kindle for reading as well as some of the features of a tablet, this is an excellent value for the price. i like the flexibility of being able to switch between the book i am reading and my email or other web uses.it seems like the battery discharges rather quickly compared to my other kindle. i often keep this one plugged in while i am using it.

i purchased two of these tablets to replace all the other brands that stopped working within a two month period. so far so good! it's a perfect fit for my two younger children. and i feel you can't beat the price for a fire. i have control on what they access. the only downfall is the micro usb socket within the unit is loose. when charging i have to fiddle with the plug to ensure it stays in the unit.

i am pleasantly surprised with amazon's new 5th generation kindle fire.as a purchaser of a 1st generation kindle fire, i welcomed the addition of a dual camera option plus the expansion of a microsd slot. this version of the fire is lighter in the hand and seems to hold up well to my handling of the device.the new os seems to work well in spite of the ""commercial"" aspect. after finding the appropriate setting to turn off the promotional ads, my fire became more enjoyable. this feature was not a surprise but what i would expect in a device from amazon and its ecosystem.the kindle fire is an excellent 7inch tablet for its 50 price and the perfect entry in the arena of small tablets for the newby.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this tablet to replace a digit and one that was on recall. the amazon ecosystem is nice and the tablet seems to work pretty well. i like the options for limiting screen time especially being able to get nature that reading goals are met first. unit needs more on board memory however. make sure to buy an sd card to expand.	iPhone

giving these out as gifts this holiday season and couldn't be happier! great price point, perfect size and easy to enjoy for anyone in the family!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this amazon fire tablet is amazing. it's not an ipad or galaxy, but it still packs a ton of value into a nice package. you get a lot of nice features here, and not a lot of bull, as one would often expect from a device so cheap. the screen is surprisingly well made and durable. while it's not the sharpest one out there, it's not exactly blurry either at 1024 x 600 pixels. there is only a single speaker, and no sort of flashlight aside from the screen. the speaker gets to a decent volume, but i would not consider it to be loud. i took a leap of faith here in buying this and i am so very glad that i did because this tablet has far surpassed my expectations in every way. the games are smooth and fast with minimal lag from what i've seen so far. this plays demanding 3d games pretty well i may add. the amazon store has a lot of cool free things to mess with when you first start out. it only took about a half an hour or so to set up and update everything. the micro sd slot accepts up to 128gb cards. battery life is ok. if not gaming on this, you can expect 6 hours or more. with light use, this could last all day on a single charge. video is smooth and the screen is nice and surprisingly bright. the responsiveness of the screen is spot on. i can't really mention any downfall , because there really isn't any. the one thing i will say could be better it the wifi. when set to default settings, wifi kept turning off on me. once i set wifi up to be always on, it was much better. you usually get what you pay for. in this case, you get more. this unit feels like it could have easily cost well over 100. i'm just sad that i didn't yet get a protective case for mine. i would highly recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone who needs a nice tablet or wants a nice gift for someone. this amazon fire 7 inch tablet earns a solid 10 out of 10 stars from me. i'm picky too. if you are even slightly considering this, just buy it. you won't be disappointed.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great features and for an excellent price. i bougth it for my son, 6 yrs old. it allows me to control what features he can use, apps, books, videos, etc. he used an android one my wife's before, and with this he still has access to all the apps he regularly used.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i have dabbled in the market for a inexpensive tablet for a while and found this and boy am i glad i did. tablet runs faster than i thought and has a very good display. if you can't afford an ipad get this!	20in Monitor
first i must say out of the box i'd rate this tablet 3 stars for a few reasons.1no google play store which means no google apps and stuck with amazon app store.2have to pay 15 to remove ad filled lockscreenhowever i rooted the device within 30 minutes of owning it which ainstalls google play services and bremoves the ad lockscreen. the tablet is now easily 5 stars. i wanted something to mainly read books, magazines and news on. this does those things great. i've also tested a few videos form a few sites like prime video youtube and it works great. sure, there are better looking tablets out there with better screens but this one works fine for what i want.overall i'd highly recommend this tablet if you root it and install google play store. if you want to keep it as is out of the box, i'd recommend staying away from amazon and going a full fledged andriod tablet like samsung.

have a kindle with a broken screen. bought originally for 99.00. now regular price is 49.99 and were on sale black friday for 34.99. got 2 more.	Lightning Charging Cable
the tablet exceeded my expectations for 35. kids love to play games on it and is great for social media.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
bought this during the black friday sale for 35 and can't complain at all. keeps my kids busy, and runs hearthstone, that's all i need.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
we are pretty unhappy with this purchase. several of the most popular apps instagram, you tube, etc. are not compatible with this device. now i know why the sale on this was so great. we can really only run the internet and facebook on this device. will be returning and getting a different tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is the third one in our house. it's great for book reading, surfing the web and checking emails	Wired Headphones
i bought two of these as gifts for christmas. one for my mom and one for a 9 yr. old. i'm a tech geek so i think these are great to introduce to and older parent or small kid just because of the price alone not for us tech guru's. i got them on black friday for 34.99. great e reader and awesome for games like candy crush. only downside is the 8gb but for 34.99 that's not even an issue!

my wife loves it she uses it every night to read her romance novels so if my wife's happy i'm happy!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
so having this amazon tablet for about a month or so it has its pros cons let's be clear you aren't getting an ipad with amazing specs but you are getting an entry level tablet great for kids or for regular things like browsing the web emails. the camera on here isn't really the best you're better off using a potatoe ha it's similar to the camera on the razor from back in the day. watching videos on here is alright you aren't getting 1080p when i tired watching videos on higher resolution the videos would work correctly i think 720p was a little too much but then again could be my wifi connection but overall it's great for the price really easy to carry around great for trips to keep any kid busy only thing i really didn't like was the ads on the home screen so for 50 sometimes even lower its a great pick really worth it ! remember it's a 50 dollar tablet compared to a 5001000 tablet it's not going to be the same but it does get the job down	20in Monitor
for the price that i paid for this tablet, ut is a great deal. it does exactly what i bought ir for	Macbook Pro Laptop

i bought this for my 7 year old for christmas. i set it up and then wrapped it so its ready to play as soon as it is unwrapped. free apps are good, some l get on my android are not available here. school websites dont work. wish i had waited for black friday price but am overall happy with purchase.	Wired Headphones
what can i say, for 50 dollars this tablet surprised me. i did buy it during black friday when it was on sale, yet still worth the 50regular price. it may not have the best screen resolution nor screen size yet it runs smooth. i have been able to watch netflix and play games on it with no problem. plus your able to expand the storage up to a 128gb that is crazy. this is going to be my travel tablet and i did buy a second one for my cousin for christmas. i think overall for 50 dollars you can't complain and am very happy with the purchase made.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

the weight and inches of the tablet is convenient for traveling	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this as part of the black friday sale. for 40, it serves well as a light use tablet skype, email, video, etc.. the ads and heavy amazon product front load push are annoying. can't change or hide any preloaded features. can't complain much for the price and the fact that i won't break a sweat if it falls out my car or gets misplaced.	Wired Headphones
i bought this for my 8 yr old niece, she loves it. also bought a screen shield a 'kid proof' case. however, neither stopped the screen from cracking the first time she dropped it. at least it was only 50 my nephew has an 1st gen ipad air, w a kid case he's dropped it many times, the screen is fine. you get what you pay for.	20in Monitor
the whispersync technology that allows a child to read a book and listen to the audio book while it highlights the words is an indispensable tool for young readers.	27in FHD Monitor
i have really enjoyed this device. it works very well. only thing i was disappointed with was that when i bought it the cashier at best buy said if i found it cheaper in another store, or online that would give me the difference in the money. i did find it cheaper online but the manager refused to give me the difference of 15. i suggested they not tell customers they would honor a cheaper price when they won't really do it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this as a gift as i was on a budget, i figured it would be okay but i got say it is actually faster than my ipad air with connectivity and more than abundant features and apps	USB-C Charging Cable

have now had for a month and i have to say the speed of this tablet is good. really no lag on browsing. only major downfall that some games might lag a bit. but for the most part it will do pretty much any other tablet double or even triple its price will do.	USB-C Charging Cable
we have two laptops and smart phones but love having the tablet to use instead of our phones	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased three of these for family members as christmas gifts on black friday for only 34.99 each!pros price is great, responds well to touch and running applications, small, portable, again the price is the best pro to this tablet.cons main homepage runs ads in the background? why? , apps are only available through the amazon app store making a very limited selection compared to google play and the app store for apple but again this equal to the tax i paid on my ipad air.	Apple Airpods Headphones
kids love it.only issue that bothered me is that my reduced price came with ads that in order to be removed i had to pay money. other than that good product	27in FHD Monitor

gave this as a gift to my husband. he likes it very much, but wishes it came with a separate manual of written instructions for using the different functions. he's not a fan of searching for instructions on a device he's not familiar with in the first place. that's frustrating.	Google Phone
perfect little tablet for my son for christmas. the price makes it a steal for a tablet these days. in addition it meets the requirements a 7 year old has for media needs. he's able to read his homework on it nightly plus take pictures of which he's addicted to lately!	USB-C Charging Cable

i was looking for something inexpensive but with a large enough screen that i could use it to read musical charts off of when i perform and this little tablet has been a great solution for me. the screen is sharp and bright, the wifi picks up fairly weak signal and makes good use of what's available, the file hierarchy is fairly simple to navigate. it seems built fairly well and for 39, i'm happy.	Wired Headphones
my nephew liked it and uses it, might not be an ipad but it works	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this tablet for my 4 year old and also one for my father. both are able to use this for their own purposes and are very happy. price is good, especially since kids tend to be a bit rough with electronics. plus for profile creation and restricting access to features from kids.	27in FHD Monitor
easy to use. looks good. the prize winner was very pleased.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i am amazed with this tablet. for the price i expected something cheaply made to last a short while. i was wrong! very sturdy yet light enough not to give you handarm cramps while holding it for long periods of time. if you have any downloads you will need a separate sd card for memory. the down side to this is that if you do not install it before you start using it, you may have to reboot the tablet to get it to engage your new memory. the standard 8 gig will only hold what the machine needs and maxing out the internal memory may make it lock up. i put in a 32 gig card and downloaded several movies and books and it still have a ton more space and runs really fast no streaming issues. we recently took it on a week long vacation and it was great to have downloaded games, books, movies, etc for the teens to watchplay. overall, a great product for a really great price!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is a good started tablet for children.	20in Monitor
very simple setup and a great little item for the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i think this is a great product solution, especially for the price. i needed to replace my portable dvd player. i have 2 young kids and still wanted something to play movies on the planes and during car trips. after looking at my options i decided on getting them both a kindle for about the same price of 1 dvd player. heads up the disney anywhere app takes some work to download the movies on the kindle but there is a way. you have to access it through amazon movies in order to download them. i got a microsd card to store the movies on and so far so good! they held up, supplied games, movies and when there is wifi they can play abcmouse to get some learning in there too. great buy. good luck getting those movies downloaded	27in FHD Monitor

i had been searching for a reliable and durable tablet for my child, after various reviews i went through with purchasing a pair of the kindle fires. for my child it is perfect, he's able to play games and videos without much issues. being a young child durability is required as was low cost, this item has more than met expectations. for an adult it is more a passable option as the os can be frustrating and the unit will lag on occasion.	Flatscreen TV
i'm an android developer, and as such have owned and operated maybe 20 android devices and 10 ios devices in the last five years. honestly, the fire is a bit faster and more stable than many tablets 23x its price. i find the ui a bit cluttered it takes a fair amount of swiping to get where i want, and the home screens stretch on a bit with the default arrangement but its a wonderful way to read books, check the internet, and do general web browsing. and since its a major name brand tablet , its very easy to find screen protectors and cases at even five below, which fit it perfectly. too many cheap tablets are such a small, specialized item that you'll never be able to find replacement parts or matching cases. overall, one of my three favorite devices out of 30 or so.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i recommend this product and best buy to friends and family members	34in Ultrawide Monitor

so i've been wanting a fire since they originally came out read some questionable review's about kindle basic stuff nothing seemed to really discourage me you really don't know what your experience will be unless you try so i got it and began the prime ""free trial "" i was shocked to wake up this morning to find out i had been charged 107.00 for a full year of prime one day before my trial was supposed to end no email no contact no are you interested they just charged my card without warning imaginably upset with amazon. the tablet it self is so so and is slightly basic the front facing camera is slightly better then the outwards one the alexa feature is kinda nice and fun to talk to it also sync's to other echo devices as well if buying for a teenager or any young adult do set parental controls and or passwords to keep from unauthorized perchues i think the tablet is ok but no great but because of my recent experience i rated it it 2 stars your ultimately going to make up your own mind and decided if your going to purchase this device and decide if its right for you good luck in your decision	AA Batteries (4-pack)

come on i bought a brand new amazon fire for 39! i can download and read my books. i can browse the internet. i can probably do other things if i ever get around to that! it's not a pc. it's not a gamer machine. but what it is is ridiculously useful for the pittance you pay. if you're actually looking at this review trying to decide whether or not to pay forty bucks for this kindle you should probably ask yourself what do i expect to get for this price? one steak dinner, 34 of a tank of gas, a case of brews. or something that's going to last for several years and actually make it easier for you to improve yourself reading! you really ought to buy one for yourself and one for your grandkid like i did. have i convinced you yet? or are you expecting amazon to come to your door and hand you a new kindle for free?!	iPhone
good tablet wish i could download apps on it like on my phone such as bank info, n other app i use would b more beneficial for kids	Lightning Charging Cable
i love my kindle fire it is very convenient and handy, perfect size	Vareebadd Phone

i really like the amazon fire tablet because it is easy to navigate, the size of the screen is good, and the weight of the product is not too heavy. i purchased the first one for my husband a couple of years ago, but he broke it and i decided that it would be a great christmas gift for him since he really enjoyed the first one. because i really like the product, i have recommended it to several people who have purchased one.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

purchased for my son for christmas and he loves it . great price	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was a gift therefore i cannot have a very good review of the item.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
for the price this tablet is not bad it was a 35 black friday purchase. it does amazon prime, netflix, surfs, etc. it is not a truly ""open"" android system, as it's locked down in some ways by amazon i.e. you cannot easily access the google play store. some apps do not run on this tablet presumably due to system specs. i think i had trouble getting disney channel app for this tablet, which is a shame.but for 35, it's hard to expect too much.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is the 3rd kindle fire i have bought. this one was a present for my nephew. i love the fire tablets, the graphics and picture quality is great. amazon offers many of the same high quality apps as apple. i actually have an ipad too but would rather play on my fire tablet. i have used my fire tablets in classes, read magazines and books, and watch tv shows and movies for free as i have amazon prime.	27in FHD Monitor
my daughter loves it its very easy to use i got the child proof case also	AA Batteries (4-pack)
got this tablet for 35 for an older family friend and it is simple to use. certainly doesn't have a ton of capability, but is more than adequate for basic email, web surfing and taking photosvideos.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
once i learn how to use all of the apps i am sure i will enjoy it more but i do have trouble scrolling	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought 2 of these for my niece nephew! they think i'm awesome now! i'd say they were definitely worth the purchase.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

gave this tablet to my daughter for xmas, now she can enjoy playing her games on the tablet	Wired Headphones
we got this for my dads girlfriend this year for christmas and she was able to just start using it right away. it is a bit akward to hold since it is so long but its not too bad. compared to my tab s2 it is pretty close when it comes to responsiveness. if you want something that is very easy to use and you dont mind the amazon marketplace constantly trying to insert ads and sell you things this is an awesome tablet that can actually have some of that stripped out if you know what to do and how to do it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got it for my 11 year old and she loves it. she can get email, help her with homework etc. the only downside is we can't figure out how to get google apps.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

we bought it for our kids and they love it its really easy for them to use it	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this tablet for christmas and only used it for one day. the next day i could not use it, it keep glitching. when i got it, the box was opened and it had an inspect sticker on the box, i guess that is what best buy does. i think someone switched it out. i took it back to best buy to see if someone could fix it and they said it would be 200 to fix or call amazon. why would i pay 200 to fix a tablet that was 40. amazon is replacing my defected one for free after many attempts to fix it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
we purchased this for mu husbands mother and she seems to really be enjoying it and it seems user friendly for her	34in Ultrawide Monitor

easy my kids love it.easy set up .easy to use	Wired Headphones
it took me a bit to warm up to it, going from a 10"" tablet to this little 7"", but it is rapidly becoming my go to. the video quality is great, and the audio is more than adequate for a small tablet. i love the convenience of having a smaller tablet my only wish is that the battery life was a bit longer than the 7 hours. that said in sleep mode it lasts days. very happy, and will be purchasing a larger fire tablet in the future.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i bought this for my kids aged 7 and 3. it's strong, bright, light weight, affordable and easy to use. i have never used any of the amazon fire products so there was a learning curve but and hour later i feel like a fire pro.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was a gift for my 11 year old daughter. she absolutely loves it. we have had 3 other tablets in the past all different brands, and she tells me this is the nicest one so far. we have only had it for about a week, but it has sure gotten it's use very happy with this purchase.

this tablet is great for the kids. and it was cheap when i got it. its recommendable for kids when they play games	USB-C Charging Cable
i was hesitant to buy, thinking the tablet would not be very good, but for the price of 49.99, it's been great for my teenage niece. she uses it to watch movies, fb, you tube, and web.	Lightning Charging Cable
the fire is good had to buy a extra memory card. the charger is shorter than it should be. my son likes it	Wired Headphones
tablet is working good. i brought it for my daughter as a christmas gift. it features a freetime app for kids only that way they cant download and surf the browser. my only complaint is that when u turn the tab off and log into the kid profile it has to download all the apps again.	Lightning Charging Cable
my son loves this. we've had two other tablets, both cost about the same as this. the others were pretty unusable. this table is fantastic, definitely great value for the money.	USB-C Charging Cable
very hard to set up child profile without paying for a subscription to freetime. once i got it finally set up though, runs smoothly, but battery doesn't seem to last very long.	Flatscreen TV
i decided to buy my son a tablet. after lots of research, this turned out to be the best one for it's price point. it even has expandable memory! so if you want a simple go to tablet i highly recommend this one!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is a great tablet at a great price. it is very user friendly.	iPhone
for the price i think this was a ""best buy"" it made for a great christmas gift	Wired Headphones

for the price this was an ok purchase.the camera picture is not very good to say the least but overall ok for the price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
a fast and good quality tablet for the money that you spend.	27in FHD Monitor
purchased two of these tablets for christmas presents 10 yr old and 7 yr old children. had researched them prior to buying so new what they were capable of and what they weren't. pleasantly surprised with overall performance and durability. no, they are not ipads, didn't expect them to be, but at a sixth of the cost they do their job extremely well.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my son, he really loves it for reading and playing games.	Wired Headphones
bought for my youngest and he loves it. very easy to work and fast downloading. great investment until he wants the real thing.	Vareebadd Phone
this is for our 2 year old. yes, she is 2 and yes she knows how to use these. this tablet is perfect for simple use, children, reading, etc. i wouldn't want to boggle it down with hundreds of apps, but this does it's job and was a great deal at that price!	Lightning Charging Cable

really slow but for 25 dollars who am i to complaint, i just use it for books and my kids for games.	USB-C Charging Cable
i like the color quality of the tablet and the size is perfect for at home or on the go.	ThinkPad Laptop
it is a great product for the price, does need the expansion card for memory!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
system overall is fast and i mean for less that 50, its very reliable.the only downside, its uses almost 50 of the internal storage already, os and builtin apps . should have settled for 32gb or more.other than that, this toy is just ok	Lightning Charging Cable
i like it allot, but the memory size is somewhat limiting. i thought that i could save and run apps from the sd card, but it seems that most of the app still need to reside in the internal memory.also beware that android apps will not work on a kindle. kindle fire apps need to be downloaded from amazon.	USB-C Charging Cable
great product used by all ages and everyone love it	Apple Airpods Headphones
like the fact that you can add extra memory to this tablet. overall great for travel for books and videos on amazon.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

good starter product for someone. if you use this a lot, the 8g is not big enough.	USB-C Charging Cable
we bought this tablet for my 75 year old father who wanted something handheld to play games and read his email. it is good for that. screen is too small for elderly eyes but it made him feel like he was getting with today's technology . it was very cheap on black friday!	Lightning Charging Cable
excelent tablet, great price. it's good for any age. you don't need to expend a lot of money, we bought on thanksgiving and we paid less than 49.99.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

if you want a tablet to watch movies and use with prime, this is awesome for the money. not great to browse with but will get the job done. can't beat for 35	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i can't believe it's so cheap now. i had the previous model and it was great. i mostly use it for reading, but it's great that you can add other apps to pass the time.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a great entry point into the tablet market. this was a purchase for my father in law and he really enjoys it. it is a bit on the smaller side but he wasn't sure if he would want a tablet. so far he really seems to be enjoying it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i want to start out by pointing out that i honestly was not expecting much to begin with. i was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night. my problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable. just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you're new to amazon fire. this is not representative of the experience of owning one.	Wired Headphones
real good deal. nice present for those who want a tablet	Google Phone
good gift for basic internet use browsing emails .	USB-C Charging Cable

i purchased 3 of these on the black friday sale 34.99 each and received them in 2 days! had to wait until christmas to have them opened by my kids to see their potential. great tablet and features especially kid mode but have only one complaint so far.one of the tablets had a bad digitizer right from the start and had a horrible time trying to use the tablet. hence only giving this item a 4 star rating as this issue should never happen right out of the package. however bestbuy is doing everything to make sure i'm a happy customer by ""price matching"" when the item is available completely sold out everywhere. other than that issue this tablet is user friendly, fast processingweb browsing, decent battery life and great wifi connection doesn't drop signal like other tablets. would recommend!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
if your connected to amazon the tablet is great to use.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the tablet was cheap and a great deal. the kids love it. it is very nice because it has a kids mode and a separate parent mode.	USB-C Charging Cable

this little tablet is just what i needed. easy to use and functional with a good display. for cloud access, reading email, internet, using apps, music and photo storage what more can you ask for. expandable memory this really has nearly everything you could want on an inexpensive device. don't worry ads don't get in the way they are only one the first screen.	20in Monitor

bought thd fird for my daughter and she uses it primarily as an ebook reader.	27in FHD Monitor
i'm so happy with my purchase. i use it mostly as a kindle. it's a bit heavy to hold for an hour of reading. proping it on my lap or a pillow solves that issue. it performs better than i expected for a 49 tablet . my wife returned her 800 ipad pro after a week of comparing the two devices. only 4 stars because of the weight and the home screen advertisements. both are minor issues.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
a no frills budget tablet. although it can do some light gaming, i would not recommend it for that, its best at watching video, browsing the web and reading,	AA Batteries (4-pack)

bought it for my 16yr old for christmas and she loved it.uses it to surf the internet and social media. also uses it for movies and music. great deal for the price, would recommend.	USB-C Charging Cable
purchased it tonight, time is wrong, you cannot change time manually because it has to have wifi to update the time.and it won't connect to any wifi that needs a passcode or password because it has to have correct time! this is 2016 technology amazon? i've had many devices, but none that make you find a wifi without a password hard to do because starbucks, hotels, etc. all need you to click to agree to their terms for wifi. all because the time cannot be changed without wifi!returning it tomorrow!p.s. also an issue on the amazon forums, so i am not the only one dealing with this!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this tablet for my mom as an additional after xmas gift. she likes the cleansimpleno fussetc. way a tablet works, ie, no keyboardmouseetc., just your fingers for input.	20in Monitor

this tablet was a great buy. the price was lovely, so i purchased three of them for my nephews for christmas! they love them! they've been very functional for what they are being used for. i have no complaints and they don't either!	Wired Headphones
good deal. i recommended this tablet to several family members.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i picked this up during black friday and managed to get it cheaper than msrp. my girlfriend and i have it in the living room to pick up and use whenever another screen is occupied by something else. it's very useful, and since we weren't looking for anything with deep features, it was well worth the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for myself on black friday and am very pleased. for a fifty dollar tablet, it has a great display and battery life. it's capabilities are below many system requirements of applications and games meaning they may not run at all or if they do, poorly. that's fine for my needs as appsgames aren't my focus. if you're buying a tablet for gamesapps i would recommend looking past the amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. in that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.i use my amazon fire 7"" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. it works great for my needs. the volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so i have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. it's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' note the invisible screens for this tablet are such a pain to install and in my opinion not even worth it. if you want to protect the screen, i would recommend going with amazon's fire case it's very nice quality and the cover flap flips over to protect the screen when you're not using it.my point, if you know what you're getting and are ok with that, you're going to really appreciate this tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
great to use and i like the larger screen. it is fast and easy to use.	ThinkPad Laptop
the tablet stop working after the second week. i couldnt find the receipt to return it. its just beencollecting dust	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
amazon did a fantastic job. i gave it to my father as a christmas gift and he loves it.	Wired Headphones
you give an amazing 7 tablet, with front and rear facing cameras, a nice interface, fairly snappy performance and durability, all for under 50 bucks! i cant imagine not buying these for your kids, but not a primary tablet for a techie adult by any means.i f you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want, this little tablet definitely delivers the value.	USB-C Charging Cable
this tablet works really well, but the pictures, etc. appear a little small but overall this is a good table. it does what i need and i got it at a great price!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
it is perfect for anyone and especially for a child moving on from a kurio. it is easily regulated by a parent with the parental controls.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
you get what you pay for. the camera is terrible but i bought it for games and reading. the ads can get annoying but for what i paid for its a good product	Apple Airpods Headphones
it's fast ,well build would recommend for anyone who has young kids	iPhone
this is the first time that i've used a kindle tablet. i've used android and apple devices before, and this is a different beast. people that are used to an android experience, will not be thrilled with this device. even though it looks like android, the play store is not available and not all of the basic apps are included in the kindle store. if i had to do it all over again i'd spend an extra 50 or 60 and get an actual android tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
the screen is clear and great for playing games and watching videos.doing homework is easier	Wired Headphones
not the fastest for loading web pages, but apps run smoothly. i've noticed that internet connection will not function if there is not enough room in memory, so delete some apps if you cannot access wifi. great for netflix, flixter and games. good resolution, just short of hd, but can tell the difference if hd is chosen over sd when given the choice while watching movies.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i like the kindle fire over all, but the kindles definitely have issues with the charging ports. we have the older 7s and we have issues with getting the cords to charge them. as a parent, you are better off not having children plug them in. we still continue to purchase new one because of the reasonable pricing and due to all the amazon app purchases we have made through the years. hopefully one day they will design a better charging port	iPhone
i bought the fire for my grandson and he loves it.	Wired Headphones
it is exactly what we wanted. great product we love it great service, quick and gave us exactly what we wanted.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good product for the price my granddaughter loved it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
brought it for my mom and she loves it . it is easy to use and it works great!	Lightning Charging Cable
picked one of these fire tablets up today for the crazy price of 39.99. i didn't really need it, but the extra 10. of was just too tempting. charged it up, connected to wifi and all was good to go. played around with it for a couple of hours and it worked perfectly. video and sound were good, speed was nice, and i am really impressed with the price. my wife's kindle paperwhite case cost as much as this full feature tablet. time will tell about longevity, but first impression is, this is a great little tablet.

i bought this tablet for my wife and she loves it!	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a fine tablet for 49. a bit heavy and not the most advanced piece of technology but for 49 it isn't bad.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's great for doing anything on amazon. however you cannot use google cards to purchase anything with. they're great for reading books surfing the net games, are abundance and the processor is fast so you really don't have a lag	Macbook Pro Laptop
bought these for christmas, and it was the hit of the gifts! the kids and adults loved them. the adults appreciated the ability to monitor the fires, liked to use them also.	Wired Headphones

my granddaughter really loves it. she was so anxious to start using it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this for my son thinking it would be a good beginner tablet. i was so wrong. i couldn't even get it set up for him to use it. before you comment that it may be the user, i have set up every electronic device i have purchased for myself or my children compters, cell phones, lap tops, game systems this tablet would not connect to wifi. i even took it across town thinking it could try that but still nothing. maybe it was defaulty equipment. i sat right beside him and had perfect wifi. my other son sat right beside him had perfect wifi.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

great little tablet for kids. fast and easy to use.	Wired Headphones
i would recommend this tablet to everyone that wants a tablet. it is real easy to play games, facebook and google.	USB-C Charging Cable
this device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had google play. however amazon chose to block access to it. this took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. this is my last amazon branded product.if you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.

love my tablet, it is now my best of best friend!	Vareebadd Phone

this is a great table for an amazing price! it's perfect for reading books, playing games, checking email, etc. i would definitely reccomend this!	Wired Headphones
i got this on black friday for unbelievable price of 32. it doesn't have much space internally but with a sdhc card you can add up over 100 gigs.amazon has its own browser and it was very easy to set up. if you want a decent tablet , that you don't expect too much from then this is it.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a great tablet for the price. it comes with amazon app store and has plenty of apps and selections. don't miss this deal!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the price was good, and while it worked, the tablet was decent, but about a week later the screen began to turn all white. i performed a factory reset, as the screen was barely visible but that did nothing. heard it was a common problem with these. won't be buying again, but if the issues are fixed in other models i would look at those.	Wired Headphones
the amazon fire 7 inch turned out to be a good deal. the screen resolution is better than i thought. the battery is very good.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it's like having the world in the palm of your hand it really is .it does everything you need it to do and fits in your pockets and when you hold it the balance is so perfect it's like holding a baby. i highly recommend for the times when your lap top is just too much	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this as a gift for my 7 year old niece and she loves it! it's entertaining and easy enough for her to navigate through!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet for the money. good way to see if you prefer a tablet or a laptop without spending a bunch of money to find out. works good to stream movies or surf the web.	iPhone
this is a good product for the price. it does do the basic things right. it however would need a bunch of features to be added to make it a great product.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this for my niece. she loves it! i am happy she is enjoying it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased 6 of these tables for christmas presents and was extremely surprised with how well they work for the price. the amazon environment takes a little getting used to but the functionality of the tablet is great for the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this one as a christmas gift. employee was very excited to receive and still loves the tablet.	Flatscreen TV
i purchased this as a gift for a child. after i read tons of reviews and asked my nephew how he liked his. it was great for the price i just wish amazon would allow you to sync your google play.other than that great product and great experience at best buy	Wired Headphones
this is a great kindle for the price. smaller travel size with enough power for general use. does seem slower than other tablets but for a backup or travel companion, you can't beat it.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
one has to keep the price of this in mind. for just 40 you do indeed get a lot. it performs fairly well too for the most part. i didn't notice any lags or anything but the resolution isn't very highgood and it's not the best display if you plan on doing lots of reading. it's just fine for videos though. the tablet has an overall cheap feel to it but then again have to keep the low price in mind.	27in FHD Monitor
great price only not enough memory i bought an extra memory card and my wife was very pleased. it was a very good birthday present!	27in FHD Monitor
perfect size and features for my 9 year old daughter.fire is made well.she loves it to read and to play games on	iPhone
i like to read before sleep to help me wind down from busy days, i love being able to quickly download books and take them with me wherever i go also. i use this kindle to play games sometimes also, but it's a bit slow for that at times. perfect ereader though, and a great price!	Wired Headphones
great tablet for the price, the only problem i have had is getting it linked to mr printer.	USB-C Charging Cable
i heard about the kindle from a friend . so when the bb clerk told me about the kindle fire, i decided to buy one. i am very happy that i did. now whenever something comes up on tv that i don't understand, my kindle fire finds the info very quickly.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
it's actually pretty nice. i bought 2 of them for the kids to keep them quiet around the house or while driving in the car. they've downloaded all sorts of games, and watch movies when they have wifi. getting started at the beginning was a little tricky setting up a new account, but after that. everything works just fine. no complaints. i would recommend this product for the little ones for road trips.	Vareebadd Phone
i can't stop using it. it's all you ever need in a tablet, netflix,youtube,facebook,games,music,movies and much much more! great screen resolution and all for an affordable price!	USB-C Charging Cable
good fit feel in your hand when using this device.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
let's be honest, i didn't think i would be really satisfied with a 50 tablet. but i thought this would be good enough for web browsing, email and the occasional youtube or netflix video so i bought it. this tablet has exceeded all of my expectations. this kindle fire is better than the one i paid 200 for a couple of years ago and comparable performance to my ipad3. it is more responsive and has an expandable microsd slot for more memory. the only detractors are the weak speaker, the cameras only adequate for skype, not for taking pictures, and the placement of the volume buttons on top.would have preferred side buttons like almost every other smart device. however, i liked this so much that i'm going to get another one for my teenage daughter!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it doesn't work good and it is very slow and that ability is not a good working tablet i would not recommend it	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i bought this tablet to keep my ipad home during a trip overseas. i'm amazed with the performance of this tablet. it is fast, the screen is crisp and it provides pretty much everything i need. cameras and speaker are low quality but not a deal breaker for me. i don't take pics with my ipad and usually use headphones. free games from amazon underground, free amazon cloud for three months a the peace of mind it gave me made this purchase a great decision. it also,makes a great reader. love this little gadget.

not sure of quality. his first kindle fire would no longer charge properly. it was cheaper to get a new one rather than attempt to have the old one fixed. he has already had a problem with this one charging properly however, i believe the problem might have been with the charging cord and not the tablet itself.

can't beat the fire tb at 50. was able to root it in about 5min to get google apps installed and use it like an android tab. i mainly bought for reading to use the blue shade feature which is great. only complaint is the processor is little lacking compared to phones with the same specs	Flatscreen TV
a very good price for the tablet. the sound volume is a little low. needed someone with technical knowledge to help me setup the tablet.	Flatscreen TV
i bought this fire for my son for primarily reading. definitely not as good as the antiglare ones. if i were buying again for that purpose i would upgrade to the ones specifically for reading. as a tablet, it is a little difficult to navigate. it seems very cluttered. does the job though.	LG Dryer
we bought this tablet primarily to use the kindle reader. the layout is muddy and things are a bit hard to navigate. once you figure it out, it isn't bad. not an ipad, obviously, but definitely worth the low price.	Flatscreen TV

wanted to buy a reliable and cost effective tablet. was afraid the screen might be too small. dad loved it. he is 70 and not too tech savvy but is able to browse the internet, use skype and listen to music. he is afraid he will purchase something by mistake and get a charge on his credit card.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i recently bought this for my son who hp tablet died on him a month before i got him the fire. best thing i've done! it didn't cost a lot and it's made solid with beautiful deep colors and smooth video playback. i'm seriously thinking of buying one for myself soon. if you are looking for a tablet to play games and watch movies this the perfect little travel mate for you.

i got this for myself. the price on this is amazing for what you get. yes i would of liked to get an ipad because i'm very used to apple an i have a iphone but the price difference between these it pretty much a no brainier for me.	Macbook Pro Laptop
we looked into tablets for three of our children for christmas. there were three things we looked for the ability to use it for books, games and videos and our ability to control the activity. the kindle fire gave us all those and more. i love that we can increase the storage when if we want to. i love that we can control play time. i was concerned because all of our kids were used to our ipad, but they have had no issues adjusting to the change. we are extremely happy with this purchase!	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this product is great for kids! not so expensive or fragile that you have to be super careful with it but great for the basics!	Apple Airpods Headphones
internet sucks on this thing. they need to do something better. my phone is 3x faster.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this tablet as a gift for my motherinlaw, who is not very techsavvy. she already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching tv, rather than a whole laptop. she also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. i've owned a couple amazon tablets before, so i had an idea of how they worked, and i wanted something at a low price point, so i decided on this. so far, she loves it! a couple of important pointsthe low price point comes at the cost of hardware. after using my fire hdx, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. it performed better in basic tasks loading apps, web browsing, etc than i expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.as an amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of android, but does not have bakedin access to google services including the google play store. you will be restricted to amazonapproved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to google services yourself. popular apps like netflix, skype, and facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native android.	Wired Headphones
my daughter can never put her fire tablet down she really loves it	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased this for my stepdaughter. well her dad and i are no longer together we divorced 2 yrs ago. both her parents could not purchase this for her. so merry christmas little one. she loves it . easy to learn great for pictures	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i picked up 2 of these for my girls ages 5 and7. they are constantly on them to play games and watch movies. at 50 each, these are great alternatives to an ipad. also, there is no angst if they are lost or broken.	Macbook Pro Laptop
can not beat the quality of the product for the cost.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my grandson loves this tablet. with all of the apps, and the games also!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i totally love the kindle fire tablets purchased for my grandkids. my sister purchased one in our hometown for my mother. she is equally happy. my granddaughter and grandson spend their wind down time in the evening on the tablets playing their favorite games. in addition, they want a dog and conduct research for the type of dog that the would like. overall, the tablets are easy to use and provides technology for them when they visit every other weekend. i am pleased.

i was able to get this for a great price an my son is able to read books and of course play games. great price and purchase!	AA Batteries (4-pack)

great product. purchased for my wife to replace her fire hd. she loves the screen and the fact that it fits in her pocketbook.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought one for my daughter, so i decided to buy one for me the tablet is very user friendly.	Wired Headphones
this is just a basic kindle fire for my 7 yr old child. it works fine for her. it obviously doesn't have comparable picture quality when compared to the hdx versions, but it still has the same functions. it does have a rear and forward facing camera, making it easy to take pictures of the dog. there are lots of safety features and apps for kids also.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i love this kindle! my old one lasted about two years before it died so hopefully this one will hang in a little longer because i use it all the time.	Apple Airpods Headphones
can't beat the price and features on this tablet. all the features are competitive even with amazon's proprietary operating system and appstore. most common google play apps are available, but if they're not, chances are there is something analogous. navigation can be a little cumbersome as it isn't as customizable as some might like, but bottom line is, it's a pretty full feature tablet for fifty bucks.	Wired Headphones
i bought for the wife, she's still using her old one. don't know why	AA Batteries (4-pack)
you can't go wrong either with kindle or with the price. very good buy.	USB-C Charging Cable
he loves the games, that he can down loaded boos, music and videos.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a good tablet for basic functions. it was smaller than i expected. we had a fire when they first came out and i was thinking it would be the same size. the screen size is very small, but i guess that is why it was 49 instead of more expensive. it is good for reading, basic games and kids. but if you want to surf the web, it is really hard to see more than the top few inches of the webpage. it is great with the 8g, but would like a bigger screen for that price!	Wired Headphones
i bought this tablet for my dad for christmas and he loved it! i had to show him how to use it of course, but now he has the hang of it! great buy!	Google Phone

purchased as a gift for 6yr old boy. he can now play all the games he wants without having to share with big brothers!	27in FHD Monitor
pro inexpensive, compact device.con lack of protective covers	Wired Headphones
i purchased this because i wasn't sure how a tablet would work for me, and wanted to buy an inexpensive ""starter."" i was quickly sold on the convenience and ease of use. the ads are a minor issue they go away with the swipe of a finger! i'm able to watch tv and movies, access the internet via wifi, play games, and send email with ease. be aware this tablet does come with a 30day trial of amazon prime, and if you don't cancel before the end of that trial, it automatically enrolls you.	USB-C Charging Cable
my wife gave this to me for christmas and one for my daughter. for the money, i thought it wouldn't be worth it, but i was wrong. it is really way more powerful than i thought. i can do word and excel, powerpoint, pdf's, work email, surf the internet, movies, books, games.pretty much everything i thought i needed to spend 10x the money to get. i'm very surprised and happy with it. only two i would change a better picture and stop the ads on waking. this is a great value.

bought this as a gift for my niece but i use it every now and then. she loves it, gives her ebook, music, videos, games etc. all in one through amazon without having to get any external apps, most already built in. i like it as well except not so much the platform and navigating around it.

i bought this for my daughter and she loves it! one thing i dont like is the charger doesnt stay in well. its ok because i just rig it up and leave it on the charger over night. only other complaint would be she can't download same games as her brothers tablet. other than that absolutely great buy for 49.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
practical and easy to use. does what it needs to for the price	Product
i never had a legitimate reason for owning a tablet. i prefer watching shows and movies on my tv and i prefer reading actual books as opposed to a tablet. however, when i learned that best buy was selling this amazon tablet for 34.99 on black friday, i knew that i had to get my hands on one. even with the aforementioned reasons for not getting one, i couldn't argue with that price. i think it's a great starter tablet. it may not have the largest screen or hd quality but then again i don't need all of that. the quality and size of the screen are perfect for that price. 8gb may not be a lot of memory but there is also an option to get more storage via a memory card. i very much satisfied and recommend this tablet to anybody, especially those who are curious about tablets and haven't purchased on yet.

this is a great tablet for my 5 year old boy. it was inexpensive at 35 on black friday. i particuly prefer it because, with my amazon prime account, i can download videos to it. amazon only let's amazon products download videos. it was great when we traveled at christmas. no more dvds and player needed!

i bought the amazon fire 7"" tablet while walking around and saw the price 34.99 at the time. got home and set it up immediately and added the play store app by google a bit tricky the device is nice to hold , battery is above average and the screen is nice to look at. my kids started using it and after that , i couldn't even get a turn to play with it. it's a great device for the , even at regular price of 50 dollars, it still is a good purchase. my only ""concern"" about it is that i wish it had another 1 gig of ram , totalling 2 instead of just 1 gb ram. enjoy	Wired Headphones

i was truly happy with the product, however, i also purchased 4 20.00 gift cards each tablet. since i was not 100 sure as to what brand to purchase one of your sell staff advised me that i should purchase 4 google play gift cards, which i did. to my surprise, on christmas morning, my grand children were not able to use them because as your staff should have known they are not compatible! i took them to the store to exchange them and i learned that not only that best buy would not exchangerefund them but that you don't carry the amazon cards. you have just last a good customer when it comes to purchasing some items that i can purchase online at amazon or another store. i purchased an hp pc and a 12"" apple ipad at another store just to make a point. i was and still are very disappointed with your sales staff, and your sells practices. i will recommend the tables to a friend but stay way from asking assistance when purchasing the right gift cards.

i was unaware that it did not have the google play store or any formidable stores to choose from! amazon has to many app stores it would seem. i get ""turned around"" sorta speak. due to the fact that i am unfamiliar with your services. i am learning day to day, i just like to hit the ground running! but thank you for your time and sharing these devices and making them readily available to the general public! thank you, johnny young	USB-C Charging Cable

bought the fire as a way to have a cheap and easy device for my kid to play on when i wantneed the ipad, and as a secondary ereader. i have amazon prime, so adding this device to my accountamazon ecosystem was incredibly easy. i find the ease of purchasing amazon items both slick and kind of creepybut i knew that was part of the deal, buying an amazon device. i can tune it out when i need to, and parental controls are easy to manage. the device is quickresponsive color, brightness, and resolution are all quite good for a 50 device. it doesn't do everything but it does a heck of a lot for 50 bucks.

this tablet disappointed me from the beginning. i loved my previous fire tablet. however, this new one disappointed me from get go. i do not want it to tell me what i like or want! i do not like ads that pop up, i do not want suggestions for me on books, movies or anything else. i know what i like! i definitely do not want it talking to me! in this day and age, with identity theft prevalent, i would like to be able to have apps without having to turn on features like location, etc. all in all, i am ready to bust it up and throw it away!

my son wanted this on black friday and it was the best purchase! i love that there is a kid mode just for him. i wish i had bought one for myself!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
it is too narrow, if watching a vid or utube, some of the pic is cut off. can't erase the entire history. it keeps it and then recommends still based on your history, even tho you have cleared it. amazon selling all the time is very tiresome. i never go to an ad that follows me from site to site yet it's ubiquitous. tiresome. had the fire 8.9 hdx. it was perfect and they discontinued it for this line. it is a fingerprint magnet! have to clean it daily.	iPhone
the fire hd tablet is portable and very easy to use. it can be held in one hand. the device holds multiple software application options and provides a fantastic blue screen mode at night while reading. i bought three more units when the price dropped to 33 each. the screen is only slightly pixelated compared to other models due to its price point. i would recommend to others.

i am so impressed with all the things this little tablet can do. it's not just an ereader, although that's what i purchased it for. the clarity is so improved from my old kindle fire, which i dearly loved for years until my puppy got it. i was flabbergasted at all the things this little tablet can do.and it was so much less expensive than my other tablet. what a deal!

my daughter's google tablet had run its course so i purchased this. i miss the simplicity of android.	27in FHD Monitor
i use an iphone but i needed a reliable android machine to play many android games i've purchased. this fits the bill and runs android fairly well for the price. don't expect to push too much power out of this model but with some clever tweaking you can get this thing to bypass the fire os and do all your android app needs.	Wired Headphones
bought this kindle for myself, can't wait to open it.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a great tablet for the money. it gets 4 stars because there are some things that could be better. the tablet has some lag to it at times while trying to perform some operations. however reading books or watching videos is great once the connection establishes. if you understand that it's not gonna act like a more expensive feature filled tablet this is great.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good product for the price. obviously it is not as simple to use as ipad or galaxy but still a great option for those who don't want to break the bank	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this kindle fire 7 on sale. it was a no brainer. it is faster than my 2012 fire hd 7 thought the screen resolution cannot compare to the 2012 fire hd 7. screen resolution is adequate and for my use as an every day ereader, web browser, email it is perfect. i haven't used the cameras so cannot comment. i tested them out and they seem ok.	27in FHD Monitor

i bought this about 3 weeks ago and i love it! you can play games although a bit laggy, watch moviestv shows, read, and do quite a bit with it! the price is amazing! i would for sure buy this again and again! i recommend this if you are wanting a tablet to read! it is a great price for a pretty big screen! but if you are wanting more of a game tablet i would recommend an ipad or whatever is at best buy that they recommend. i definitely think there is enough gigs for a few games and some books! my rating is 1010!

the kindle is my favorite tablet for reading books	Wired Headphones
will recommend to friends and family, best tablet i bought	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i researched several different ereaders before deciding to purchase this tablet. this one was the best fit financially and it also allowed me more flexibility to access books from my local library. that feature alone is very valuable. i may decide to upgrade to something with less glare for outdoor reading, but for now this is perfect. very easy to keep in my bag and since i am an android user this was not difficult to learn.

picked up this fire tablet for the simple reason of reading ebooks purchased through kindle rather than on my phone. it's small enough i can stash it in my bag and easy on the wallet if anything happens to it. go ahead and pick up a case for it and maybe a glass screen protector for added piece of mind	USB-C Charging Cable

bought this for my 12yr old son. can't get him off of it. gave it 3 stars because it doesn't support google play store and doesn't load most pics on pinterest sometimes. you might need a memory card if you purchase 8gb tablet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i got this for a friend so she could use the internet and have more entertainment. i was happy with the cost.	Macbook Pro Laptop
definitely got the job done. this tablet is nice size and affordable	iPhone
so far the only complaint i have is not with the product but with the policy regarding the product. i had one for just about 2 weeks when i noticed a definite issue staying connected. my wife, who has had her kindle fire for months, said her started acting up if she had too many apps on it. i started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. after trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. it did stay connected to our wifi. i contacted best buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them. they said that's amazon's policy. i contacted amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new kindle was on the way to its new home. i've been pleased with it since its arrival. it does most of what i need email, facebook, minimal web use, saving ""wear tear"" on my laptop.

got it for my wife but i keep it. got to get her one now.lol	Lightning Charging Cable

we bought the tablet for my 1 year old who normally uses my ipad and samsung tablet because we wanted him to have his own so we could have ours. he was very disengaged. i believe it's because it didn't have the home and back button like our tablets do. over all it's an amazing device it just didn't keep our little one entertained	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i bought two amazon fire 7"" tablet 8gb on sale for 39.99 reg. 49.99, at best buy since i had a 10 reward coupon so only spent 30.00, saved 20.00 for one tablet and another one 2 months later with another coupon for even less for my elderly mother. both 7"" tablets exceeded my expectations and then some. i downloaded all my apps for my amazon account and google play store. setting kodi was as easy as amazon fire tv and fire tv stick, just download the apps. i love this tablet, it works very well. i bought it because i love to check my emails etc. having a 7"" screen makes it all easy and simple. as far as apps go, it has facebook, twitter, pinterest and tumblr available. it does not have instagram available at the amazon store, but it does have it at google play store. this amazon fire 7"" tablet is so lightweight, and you will love it too. as far as technology, it's an awesome tablet for the price, it's one of the nicest size tablets you can get your hands on. it's perfect for a child or an elderly person, to enjoy anywhere. i would highly recommend this tablet.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i bought mine in store, i like having what i buy right away, so i didn't feel the need to buy it online, maybe that is why other people may have had a screen problem, could have been during the shipping process because who knows how well the shipping company treats the packages.i use it mainly for watching netflix, and reading books. i love it, feels like i have a kindle, and whats great about it is that its more than just a kindle so i can do more with it. i already have an iphone, and a huge laptop so i won't be using it for like everything like other people may need it for. so it is worth the price because before i was never planning on buying a tablet because i felt like they were expensive and since i already have a phone and laptop i didn't need it but when this came out i was finally happy to find a tablet that the brand is well known and popular.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the new kindle fire's price point is amazing. at 50 this tablet is a fullfeatured device that is practically disposable.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

for 50 the kindle fire 7 is a bargain. i had the original kindle and the difference in functionality is night and day. the only minus is amazon prime is now 99 a year and it's hard to justify that unless you shop amazon alot. but still overall a great deal.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love to have books read to me but don't want to have to pay for audible. since regular kindles have long sonce done away with speakers, i had to go to the kindle fire line. i was blown away! not only can i read boops and do text to speech, i can also do netfkix, we surfing and check my email. i love me new fire and recommend it to everyone.

AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is fantastic. it's small yet biiger than my iphone. it works fast and i've had no problems with it so far. plus for the price, you can't go wrong with it. it's more than half the price of a samsung or ipad yet works just the same. don't hesitate to buy this	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
used while traveling in southeast asia to pick up emails stay in touch with friends family back in the states	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a descent tablet for kids. not all amazon apps are compatible with this is device which can get annoying. storage is limited 8gb so that too can get annoying. especially when 4gb is used before you ever get started. video quality is great but picture quality is lacking. overall the tablet is easy to use and my children 8 12 enjoy using it. i gave it 4 stars because for the cost i think it is a pretty good tablet.

this is the best tablet i have bought. it is better than the 200 kindle fire i bought a few years ago. it has wonderful apps for children as well as the great amazon apps i like!	Lightning Charging Cable
i was giving the tablet as a gift for christmas to a 3 year old. i initially purchased the ""standard version"" but returned it for the kid version which included a ""bumper box"" as well as a 2 year warranty, which the standard version did not have. thankfully, i asked the parent of the child if it was ok for me to set it up prior to giving it to the child. the set up took some time. i was thankful that i read the reviews because i bought an additional memory card since the product only has 8gb of storage. the child was able to open the gift and ""play"" immediately as a result of doing upfront work. one thing i noted that when the child played a movie through netflix, the resolution was not very good. could be an adjustment needed in the tablet, which has yet to be worked out. i would recommend this, but if giving as a gift for a child, i would recommend doing the upfront work so it is ready to go for the child when they receive it.

to start with, this is not a high end tablet. this serves the fundamental purpose of browsing and reading with so much ease. believe me, a lot better than an a low end asus tablet. i own multiple tablets of varying brands. this tablet works like a charm. for the price offered, its worth the purchase.

this is a very good tablet for the price about 50 regular price. good image quality and battery life. have been a prime member for several years, so the included media access videos, audio and books is great. it is not an android tablet, so much of the google ecosystem is not available. the amazon appstore has lots of options, but not nearly as many as the google play store.would recommend adding a microsd storage card. also would get better file manager and video playback apps. there are several good, free options from amazon's appstore.

i recently purchased this amazon fire for my daughter, i like that it has the little accent of a night light, so if we are watching a movie in the dark, she can still use it without illuminating the entire room. features are average, just like any other tablet. it is a little bulky but for a child, it gets the job done. pretty sturdy when its dropped. doesnt have much storage, but the good news is you can add your own sd to create more storage.

tablet is great for 7 inches. touch screen works great	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love this device for my kids who are way too young to trust with a 500 tablet such as an ipad. works efficiently, my kids love it, i love the parental control features. if something happens to it, amazon handles it quickly if it were to break or get lost, it's cheap to replace. that being said, it obviously doesn't hold a candle to samsung or apple's tablets. i'm not really a fan of the operating system.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
for the money if you can do without apple this is the best tablet. you just have to remember amazon sells it cheap so you have access to their media services and alexa.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

the fire meets my needs for my reading enjoyment. it is less cumbersome than always carrying around a book. i have no problems whether in daylight or at night. i would highly recommend this product.	Macbook Pro Laptop
logging in with a password can be difficult since the typed lettersare not shown, even temporarily, so inadvertent typos require guesswork to find.signing out of email is not clear, if it can be done.some ""free"" downloads fail because of lack of payment.allowing for my lack of skills. i was hoping for a little more.it was ok fort basic stuff.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

it is a great tablet, i bought it for my 11 year old and he uses it responsibly. i also bought the glass screen protector and the sky blue cover for it in case he drops it. my son loves it and enjoys being able to not only play games on it, or take pictures, or even movies, but most importantly for the use of the advantages of it for its help when it comes to his education. i strongly recommend this product to everyone.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
you could pay more and get something better but for reading comics and watching youtube this is fine	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my daughter uses this and loves it. the only complaint she had was she cannot get games from the google store because it will only allow game and app downloads from the amazon store and amazon does not have all the games. but as far as working, it does what it is supposed to.	ThinkPad Laptop

after only 4 days, the device would not charge. it was plugged in each evening and on the 4th day, it was at 7 after being plugged in all night. this was our second amazon fire tablet, the first one stopped charging in month 13, right after the manufacturer's warranty expired. decided to get another one because it was a great deal, but sadly i've learned you don't even get what you pay for with this tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
perfect tablet, such a great price would totally recommend	Google Phone
bought for mother in law to play games on. pretty simple to set up. looked at other off brand tablets but the price on this was good so we went with it. seems to enjoy it. only got a call from her for how to connect to the internet so i take that as a good sign since she's not tech savvy.

best tablet ever!cannot put it down! always ready to read, browse or watch tv shows and movies	Lightning Charging Cable
the device is good for reading on. it feels like reading a book.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it was a cheap tablet just for kids to watch movies. however, it forces you to put your credit card numbers to register the product. i don't want to since kids will be playing with it. i don't want them to be able to purchase apps without approval. reset it to factory default, but the setup changed not the same as first started. anyway, i won't but it again.	USB-C Charging Cable
tablet is great for the price. not as fast as my s7 but pretty darn good for the price.	Wired Headphones

i purchased for my grandchildren and they work fine for watching netflix or amazon movies, however, kindle offers no app for youtube which is a somewhat of a drawback for kids. nice to access books for kids to encourage reading. also like the parental controls so kids can't make a purchase without your knowledge.	USB-C Charging Cable
good reader basic tablet needs access to google play apps	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a good tablet for someone who wants a starter. nice screen, easy to use. great graphics.	Lightning Charging Cable

it is a nice tablet to have, however i do not like the setup for making a kid profile and not being able to download to their profile. also do not like amazon's charge for a kid profile.	Lightning Charging Cable

this was a gift for my son, who loves this tablet. it's easy to use, set up parental settings, and seems durable.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
well, its a little weak but its cheap. good for the amazon ecosystem if you don't want or need googleplay and all that. can still side load apps, but some might not work correctly if you need a play account like clash of clans will install but not let you log in some other things were a pleasant surprise that they actually worked, even though they were not officially sanctioned by amazon. battery life leaves a little to be desired and the tablet can get warm. cameras are not good at all, but i guess would suffice for video chat. but for a name brand and only 50, there isn't really much room to complain. the ads don't get in the way much, but you would have to pay 15 to remove them. i would leave them and save the money. bottom line, you can't really go wrong with the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my mom is not computer savvy, however she has really taken to the tablet. it is easy to us and just the right size for her to handle. so glad that best buy recommended this product for her.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
picked up this tablet for my kid, the price was very appealing. my kid loves the tablet, does everything a more expensive table to would do.	Wired Headphones
this is good tablet for price of 49.99. the camera is not really bad. one reason why i dont't like amazon tablet and cellpone is you can't download some apps like magic jack and chikka apps. i like this 2 apps because im using it international.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
portability perfectbattery greatease of use. excellent	Vareebadd Phone
not user friendly, in regards to compatibility with google play services, play store, etc. definitely needs to be improved upon	USB-C Charging Cable
i am currently using this item. it is very good product.	Google Phone
this tablet meets my needs for going online or killing time when i'm bored. the battery holds longer than my cell phone. the only problem with these is that the port you connect the charger into isn't aligned easily and is pretty cheap. i can see how the tip of the charger would break easily. that is really my only complaint since i only paid 39 dollars when it was on sale.	Wired Headphones
i replaced my old tablet with this one. i like this tablet because it has a back light and i can read in bed without disturbing anyone else.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the kindle works as it should and was inexpensive but has a short battery life	Wired Headphones

i purchased the kindle fire for a vacation we were going on and really only thought i would use it for books and maybe a few games but was surprised at how well i was able to access the internet with it. the only thing that i can say negative about it is the sun glare. in the sun it is next to impossible to see what is on the screen. indoors or shade and it is fine	AA Batteries (4-pack)

AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my daughter had her 8"" kindle fire hd stolen earlier this year so when we saw this one on sell over the thanksgiving holiday it was a no brainier to purchase it since it was 100 cheaper than the fire we purchased a year ago, granted the fire hd has a much crispier screen but for my 9 year old daughter, she is now happy just to have a tablet again. and it can do all the things she needs it to do read books, play games, skype, etc.	Wired Headphones

a must have for your baby or child! 100 free apps!	Lightning Charging Cable
the main reason i purchased this was because i like to annotate scriptures and insert personal notes or related notes to passages especially meaningful to me. it's much easier to insert comments now with the keyboard display than it was to insert comments on the old kindle i have, so that was a huge bonus. the one draw backgripe i have is the ""back"" triangle button. the scriptures i read have hyperlinks that take me to other scriptures, and before on the old kindle, i could hit the back button and it would take me back to the previous page i was on. e.g., if i was on page 10, and selected a link to page 14, the back button would take me back to page 10. with this kindle, the back button takes you back to the library, and the previous page tapswipe takes you back to the previous page, e.g., if i'm on page 10, and i take a link to page 14, it'll take me to page 13. the workaround that i discovered is using the bookmark function which is only slightly more timeintensive than the old kindle back button. the only other concern i have is the battery life. if i'm going to enjoy some long reading without heavy annotation e.g., reading fantasy, i'll probably use my old kindle. if i want to do some serious annotation and cross referencing on different commentaries e.g., scripture study, the new kindle is the better bet. the commentaries i reference are pdfs i could create a kindle book out of them, but it messes up the tables in the pdfs, and i don't care for the pdf viewer that came with the kindle because you cannot bookmark the pdf or annotate it. i purchased a very inexpensive pdf app called ""expdf reader"" which does everything i want with pdfs. allinall, the kindle fire is a great tool and fits into my lunch box, so i take it everywhere. i read that others were concerned about it's weight, but i find it to be light. i'm used to reading door stopper books, and it is definitely more manageable than one of those. a pleasant surprise i had was the ""blue shade"" feature which enables me to read at night without worry of negatively impacting my sleep cyclequality of sleep. you don't need a separate booklight for this like you do for the old kindle, so that's a nice perk too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
believe it or not, i purchased this for my 3 year old grandson, and he is doing real fine with it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

was looking for a lowpriced tablet to access my kindle and magazine apps specifically the economist. what i didn't realize was that this was the adversion of the kindle, so removing ads on it would not be possible wo fee and worse, there's some limitation around some apps and everything located in the google play store, so apps like the economist were not available. sooooo. returned.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i bought this kindle 7"" fire for my granddaughter. she has used my fiire hdx and was used to the format, so it is working out great for her. still i wanted something inexpensive in case anything destructive happened i would not have much money involved. we are very happy with it.	Flatscreen TV

this is a great tablet at a great price. unfortunately it can't connect to google play without hacking. if that's what you need, look at the acer tablet. if you are looking for an inexpensive fire tablet, you can't go wrong with this.	USB-C Charging Cable
very nice tablet. works very well. no issues. nice video, and excellentwireless wifi, just a very smooth unit.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased the tablet for my mother in law to use to read ebooks and play online games. it was very user friendly and a great price and product for our needs.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
gave this to my son for christmas. he loves it. speed is good for what he does and battery life seems good enough for him.	Wired Headphones
not a ipad that's for sure, but doesn't meant i don't enjoy it. if you have amazon prime membership this is a no brainer. its not so preciousness allows me pass it to others without the stress.	Wired Headphones
purchased this for my 5 year old daughter so she could watch cartoons on netflix. it's very durable, i use it sometimes myself, not a powerful as an ipad mini or galaxy tab but very good for the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
great product! it was easy enough for my ten year old to use. also it was easy to set it up for her. i highly recommend it for the price!	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i purchased this for my mom 4 days before christmas with 2 day free shipping. it arrived on time with no issues. my mom loves it! she likes to read digital books and watch netflix and this tablet allows her to do both. she also loves that it's small enough to fit in her purse and bluetooth capable.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
simple but effitient. i bought it to use mainly as a good cost benefit music player device. the fire has some limited apps for the purpose i get it but it works fine. as i had no tablets yet i discovered i can use it for other things. yes, it works fine as a tablet and i am learning to love it.

tablet runs well and the form factor is decent for such a cheap tablet.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
got this for 35 on black friday. has some built in ads on the lock screen and does not include play store. after replacing the system with cyanogen mod 12.1, it's amazing fast, nice battery, great build quality, glass screen. can't ask for more for under 65 or 75 minimum.	Lightning Charging Cable

bought this for my father as he is in his 60s and never had a tablet before. he loves it and it works for all his needs.	Lightning Charging Cable
amazon's free time is a great tool for parents, making this a very good tablet for young kids. you can control when the kindle turns off at night and when it can be turned on in the morning. you can control how many hours it can be used before shutting down, or you can specify hours by activitybooks, videos, and appsgames. you can even set goals, such as 1 hour of books before allowing videos and games. and you control exactly what content they can access. and when your kid's not using it, you can use it yourself with your own unrestricted profile.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i had a kindle earlier and rarely used it because the interface did not feel readingfriendly. this one is better. i am using it for two textbooks and find the interface improved. the purchase came with a free month of amazon prime which was a plus even though i decided not to renew after the month was over.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
does what it says it does and is small and convenient!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i give 1 of these put every month at work. it normally goes to their kids so they are the awesome parents.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this kindle is great for the price. however, there are some downsides to paying for a 50 tablet. the battery life goes very quickly, so daily charges are necessary if you're a heavy reader. you also can't save anything of merit like books or magazines to a minisd card, thus making a purchase of one a waste of time and money.	Wired Headphones
this is my husband's first kindle, and he is so happy that he enjoys it. he plays on it almost every night.	USB-C Charging Cable
this tablet works great for my 7 year old son. he loves it. the app store has plenty of apps. i would recommend.	Wired Headphones
you can't beat the amazon fire tablet. especially for only 50! i bought one of these for each of the kiddos and one for myself. with the amazon prime membership these tablets are on fire	Wired Headphones
excellent tablet and you can't beat the price. make great gifts for birthdays or for christmas.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i bought this for my niece and she seems to love it. great for netflix and playing games. of course you can also read books just like all kindles.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
best at its price. just bought it because its less when compared ot other leading tablets. good for skype.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is the possibly the best tablet if you are an amazon storeprime centric user. but, it doesn't include the google play store and doesn't include most any of the google apps, which are stables in the tablet world. no google inbox, etc. for me, this tablet is a ""skip"". but, it's cheap and if it meets your needs you might love it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
if you have an amazon prime membership, so that you are getting all of the videos and music, then this is a great table for tossing in your bag when on the go. its not the highest end, but works great with the amazon features for a great price	iPhone
it works great for all like to surf on the internet.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this along with the kids version for my two year old grandson this one stays at my hose the kids version at home with his parents he loves it	Lightning Charging Cable
i loved it. not only was the price good, but 8gb of memory is phenomenal!	Apple Airpods Headphones

this is a good tablet for the money. recommended for first time tablet owners.	Lightning Charging Cable
i'm an avid android user, however you'd be very hard pressed to find an android tablet of this quality in this price range. the quality of this amazon fire tablet is really great. it is not hd, but that doesn't matter to my 9 year old, who uses it to play games and listen to music. it has extremely robust parental controls, allowing parents to set a child profile and then set screen time limits, bedtimes, and limit content available. the child profile is actually a little too restrictive in my opinion, as i think my 9 year old could handle something in between full unrestricted access to amazon content and kiddie games only. overall i am very happy with this purchase.	Wired Headphones
great value. i don't have any issues with this tablet. some others mentioned ebooks were difficult to read but i don't have that problem. the storage is tight so i added a 64gb card to it. i use it every day.	27in FHD Monitor
the kindle fire tablet i purchased, is great for what i use it for, comparing pricesstores research, reading .perfect.best bang for your buck.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
finally a perfect tablet for my son. with the addition of the memory card my son is able to play the apps he wants and still have his school apps on it! i am still able to use the parental settings to keep him safe. we all really enjoy this new kindle and the price!	Apple Airpods Headphones
love the fire play games on it every day. it is small enough to carry with you but powerful enough to watch movies.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i absolutely love this tablet. i check my email. i watch movies. the only thing i do not like about the tablet is that it sometimes have problems taking you to the correct site. but you must remember that it is a tablet, not an computer. i find all in all the picture is clear and the sound is wonderful also it has unlimited cloud storage which is good and when you download a picture it takes just a few minutes. amazon prime is a must however or you will be spending a lot of money to view movies and read books as almost everything available cost money. prime is a money saver and it lasts a full year. it also comes with free shipping. i tried it and it is good. i receive my purchases in 2 days. prime is the way to go if you purchase this tablet because it comes with a lot of perks.

these were purchased as christmas presents for my grandchildren. however i did open the packages to be sure they were fully charged and updated. i was surprised at how fast the response time was and how easy they are to navigate. my grandchildren are going to love them!	20in Monitor

i purchased this amazon kindle fire for my mother. she is new to technology and loves this tablet.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
have the smaller fire hd tablet and was looking at the larger tablets but read the reviews and when this tablet came on sale at an extremely great price, purchased this one. am very happy with it although the photo quality is not as good as my samsung galaxy, it is fine in most lighting situations. it's features are good and would purchase it again.

easy to use. great for someone who wants to play some games and use simple apps.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i like the tablet. the only negative is that google apps don't work, but for the money, i don't really care that much. i mostly just use it to read	Lightning Charging Cable
i like it for the price but did notice some flaws.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this product since my wife purchasers a number of books from amazon. we also wanted easy access to our emails.	Apple Airpods Headphones
nice to review photos on mini sd card but, disappointed that photos can't be downloaded to the hard drive. better camera with ability to see what you are taking pictures rather than 3rd generation which only has only one camera lens.	Macbook Pro Laptop

i bought this tablet for my 19 year old nephew for xmas. he's currently enrolled in his sophomore year in college. i figured he could use this for some homework, projects but also for fun. after taking out and playing with it a little bit, i bought another for my mom and my 13 year old niece!	27in FHD Monitor
you get what you pay for with this product. there are better tablets, but this is a wonderful product for the low price.	iPhone
overall couldn't be more happier with the tablet works great for the price of it i would def recommend to my friends	Lightning Charging Cable
overall, this is a decent tablet. quite easy to set up. takes a few minutes to run the updates, but you'll be up and running in 15 minutes or less,build quality very impressive, this is not a cheap feeling device. it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling. the back of the device is a plastic type material but overall nice.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
so far i've had my fire tablet for over a month. its my first tablet. the lack of the googlke play store means the amazon apps are pretty limited, but i found avway around that. the front camera is grainy but acceptance while using skype. battery doesn't last long, and it seems to take hours to recharge. for a 50 first tablet, i suppose those are acceptable flaws. feels robust in the hand, though the plastic casing reminds you of its materials if you hold it tight.	20in Monitor
this is great for reading books or doodling at work.	27in FHD Monitor
resolution a little low on the screen, but excellent tablet for the price	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we bought this tablet for our son and there were a lot of free downloadable educational games and apps. amazon also gave us 25 to purchase apps and ebooks!	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchase this for my wife that she can use as an ereader. you truly enjoys it. she takes it to her book club meetings and she uses it more than her ipad.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i really enjoy reading much more. especially like the rotate feature	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this tablet is a well made tablet. be sure to get a sd card as the memory is not great. the amazon underground with totally free games and apps is worth the purchase alone. you do not need amazon prime subscription service to enjoy this little tablet. go on and purchase one for 50.00 you wont regret the purchase.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this tablet is great for the price. we ended up purchasing 6 of them. it is great for the kids and is very functional. i think the price helped lower my stress level where the kids are concerned, but it is very sturdy. would purchase again.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased the amazon fire 7"" tablet for 49.99 and i have to admit for it being my first tablet, it works great and i have no complaints so far.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this to read books and check out ebooks from the library. i love it and it's easy to use. this is in color and you can even play games on it. it's small enough to fit in my purse so while i'm at appointments i can read and if my son gets board, he can play games.	USB-C Charging Cable
for it's price point, this is a great little tablet. as long as your not looking for something to do everything, you'll be happy. this was given as a gift and the recipient was very happy with it.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this tablet as a christmas gift for one of my grandchildren, so they won't get it until then. it hasn't even been opened at this time. overall rating is based on product reviews.	27in FHD Monitor

little gem does so much for such an amazing price.	Lightning Charging Cable
works great, easy to carry. covers my needs when traveling.	Lightning Charging Cable
meets expectations consistent with the price. i don't really use it for anything. it simply can't replace my ipad. both the screen quality and battery life are poor relative to my ipad 4 from a few years ago, so i haven't found a use for this kindle fire. generally it just feels cheap and the user interface not as clean as the ipad. i think it's value is consistent with the low price point.	USB-C Charging Cable
i got it for my son he loves it very good for travel	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this is a nice tablet. it has a really good clear screen.	USB-C Charging Cable
great for the price. good for gifting, if you don't want to spend too much	Wired Headphones
it amazes me that this tablet is less than fifty dollars. is it going to replace an ipad? no but it's not meant to. it is great for watching hulu and net flix. amazon underground is pretty amazing also. well worth 50. if you are on the fence about it just buy it. you won't regret it at all.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
as a tablet noob this was the perfect tablet to start with simple to use and even simpler to understand. i like every thing about it now i want a larger screen.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought it for my nephew and he loved it. great purchase	Lightning Charging Cable
you get what you pay for, with that being said. for 50 bucks i'ts great. it's not super fast wont play heavy games. but, it will netflix and read books fine. screen is plastic, not glass like most so it scratches very very easily.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i bought this expecting the same quality i have received in the previous 3 kindles i purchased. i am disappointed. i like the price. the home screen is just all the apps right in your face, not just the ones you want, like in the older version kindle fire. i mostly use it for reading books, and so far i'm dissatisfied. it's great to swipe to the next page, but when i want to go to settings or something else while reading i find it difficult to open. instead the page just turns and by the time i finally get to the book settings, i've lost my spot! i downloaded the facebook app and it's very slow. maybe it's amazons way of telling me that's what i get for 50 but come on. sometimes i like to use the kindle to search the web and that too is slow. i compared it to my older version and there is a noticible difference in speed. i know there are other cool user tools, but for me i mostly use it to read and check facebook and maybe pinterest. it's priced well if you want it for kids, it's user friendly and my kids have already figured out all the options. i would recommend it for kids or for people who are technologically not savvy.	Lightning Charging Cable
quite simple it's a kindle fire tablet. it does exactly what it should do as a tablet attached to a reader. i like that i can send things from my desktop to my kindle. it streams well, and it works well with my bluetooth keyboard. this is actually what convinced me to do a year of prime. next year we'll see how it goes if i renew, but so far so good. the lock screen shows a different advert, but that's not so bad.it's only a lock screen.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i bought it for my nieces and nephews and they loved it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it works great, its just not quite what i wanted for my daughter.	Flatscreen TV
et me start by saying, please do not buy this tablet expecting it to be comparable to an ipad or samsung tablet. i think the people who expect that are the ones who are disappointed by its features.i personally love this tablet. i wanted a tablet so that i could read, check emails, watch shows hulu, netflix, amc, shop online and do some web surfing. i am a pretty simple gal. i did not expect much when purchasing this tablet. i assumed the picture quality would be fairly poor, that it would load pretty slowly, and that i would be unable to download most of the apps i wanted. it wouldn't have bothered me, being that i believe you get what you pay for and i could not afford an ipad or samsung at the moment. boy was i proven wrong.i was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality from the moment i turned it on. i have had other tablets and paid about the same with terrible picture quality. i actually love watching my shows on this tablet because it is as if i am watching them on my television.this tablet loads pretty darn quickly. i have never had an issue with it loading slowly or getting stuck.i have been able to download every app that i wanted, except instagram oh well, no biggie. and me being the amazon freak that i am, i was happy to see amazon apps preloaded onto the tablet shopping, music etc. . speaking of music, the sound quality is pretty great too!i am very very happy with this purchase, it really is a steal. i would buy another for sure.	20in Monitor
no issues with the product. i am a satisfied customer.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this tablet for my young nephew to watch videos on the go. it was to replace his ipad mini. this tablet does everything that he was doing on the ipad, is easy to use, and only a fraction of the cost. the advertising on it is a bit annoying, but can not complain with the price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it is easy to set up and easy to use. you can use it to watch videos from the amazon prime video or listen to music with the amazon prime music or read on the kindle. great value for everything you get.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is my second kindle tablet and i couldn't be any happier. i primarily use my tablet to read comics, they have the best comic reader on any device to read your cbz files comiccat. now that you can upgrade and add extra memory the 50 price tag can't be beat by rival companies. great for the kids. if they break it it's not as bad as breaking say an ipad at a minimum of 300.00 dollars.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my son bought this and he loves it. and it's cheap!	USB-C Charging Cable

my view comes from being only a ipad user. and my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my ipad to watch youtube cartoons, and she operates it very well.i'm giving this 3 stars because i'm returning this in less than 24 hours. so i didn't give this much of a chance. first it seems it really wants you to sign up for amazon free time 4.99 month. guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if i did that.so created the child profile on the tablet, moved the youtube app to the profile. opened the app and got selections for popular, music, movies etc. could not locate a ""search"" feature. after repeated tapping, got music to open. only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the amazon free time app"". what? so i have to join to unlock youtube? i'm technically savy so the fact that i was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. maybe there was another way around this but i didn't look. should not have to.couple this with the random ads for games, amazon prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. so going back to get a windows tablet where you click on the youtube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. for the 49.99 price i had to try this. but not for me.	Lightning Charging Cable
better quality then most tablets in same price range. i still suggests the accident protection plan or at least a okay case for it. ads on lock screen is a bit of a let down but it functions like its supposed to.	iPhone

i bought this tablet for my wife. the google app store and 8 gigs of memory were just what she was looking for.	Wired Headphones
i bought this for my 10 year old son so he could read books and of course play games. i bought a 16gb micro sd card to use with it because i knew the 8gb wouldn't be enough.my son loves it! he reads his books and plays all types of games. and thanks to the amazon underground app most of his games are free. while this tablet doesn't have enough power for me it is perfect for him!

i brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. i basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my pc. i was nervous to try again, but am so glad i did. the amazon fire 50 tablet is awesome for quick surfing tasks. i also use the kindle ereader app on it, and this works well too. the reason for my 4star rating instead of 5 is twofold, but both are related to apps. my first issue is the yahoo email app for some reason i don't have access to my contacts in it! i didn't realize this at first when i was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful. it took about a half hour because i had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people i wanted to send to so i could find their address to put in the to box of the new message i was creating. what a pain! the other issue is that the app world is dominated by ""for iphone"" and ""for android"", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. however these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why i wanted a tablet. so if you need to do quick internet searchesresearch or want to use the ereader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. love, love, love my new amazon fire tablet!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
so with that said, i cannot complain. i purchased this so i could have something inexpensive, small and could throw in my purse or pocket to read school books on the go. i own an ipad air 2. i paid 450 for that, so it's not fair to compare the two.of course amazon doesn't have the apps that apple has. if you're looking for something to read books on, but to be able to hop online from time to time on a screen bigger than a smartphone, this is it.the screen resolution isn't top of the line, the audio isn't great, but you can watch amazon video, youtube and other streaming services on this table.if you know the capabilities of this tablet, then you won't have your expectations set too high. with that said, comparing this to any other 49 tablet, this wins. with the lowend cost of this, if i had the finances, i'd find an under privileged school district and buy these for them. the features of setting these up for educational time for kids is great. if you haven't already exposed your kid to ipads, i'd recommend one of these.i think the fire would also be good for someone who isn't a techy. i don't even consider the camera on this. they could have left that off of the device, but i suppose if you purchase one of these for grandma, she can use it to skype the grandkids. i just see a lot of possibility for this because of the features and cost.	27in FHD Monitor
i went to purchase a new tablet because i had misplaced my old one. i told the sales person in that department that i was interested in one of the cheaper tablets that you have on display and he asked me if i had ever owned a kendal. i told him that i had purchased 2 of them previously and really liked them. he then told me that the newest kendal had just been delivered 2 weeks previously and it was only 48.99. i said wow that's a great price for a kendal and of course that is what i purchased. the sales person was very polite and professional. i really enjoyed the experience.

i would say this is great for kids, but the apps are very limited. there are only a few good free apps in the kindle store. the battery life is very poor. the volume is either loud or it can't be heard. it's hard to find a good middle ground. overall it's still a good tablet for the price.

this tablet replaces a tablet i've had for several years and i am very pleased with its flexibility and size. i'll expand it with apps as yet unknown. i expect it to fit in with my home network.	iPhone

i bought 3 of these. they are great and very durable . . the price is amazing .	Macbook Pro Laptop
works as any other kindle fire. does have advertisements, but for 49, can't beat the price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i had 2 other tablets that worked terrible. it wouldn't even take ebooks from the library! but this is the perfect balance between an ereader that could get boring to some people, a tablet, that uses up the battery real quick. and you don't have to connect to a computer to download the ebooks either, which is a real convenience! so i would have to say this cute little tablet is really a lifesaver for a lot of really poor people, that can't afford to buy expensive electronics. if they lose it, breaks. or gets stolen, they could easily just go buy a brand new one. the goal is to stay connected to the mainstream. it is easy to carry on the bus, bring to the park, maybe a classroom, or library, dining room, coffee shop. and not a big worry about losing a lot of , if it got lost. plus, with the ""amazon cloud"", you would never lose any of the ebooks, that you paid for, can use on all you devices. this should be considered a giftpackage from amazon, especially for new people that never had a chance to own their very tablet, always have to run to the library, or borrow someone else's. penny	Apple Airpods Headphones

i think it's good for a first tablet. i m use to the ipad so this is taking some getting use to.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this because i saw it on amazon.com. i the. went to bb just to see if they had it in stock. i fooled with the demo for about a minute and decided it was good enough to spend the 50 on. if i didn't want it i could give it to my mom or something. this thing has really impressed me. i have an ipad and an iphone 6s. the kindle isn't near the performance of those guys but i was looking to step outside my ecosystem and just get a feel for something new. besides, amazon can do no wrong. bottom line is that it's a greater starter tablet.something to have on the nightstand and let the company use.	27in FHD Monitor
this tablet is incredibly inexpensive. i have an ipad mini, a windows tablet and another older fire tablet and this newest version is one of the best tablets i have seen! it's quick, has a great screen and the battery is great. i bought this to take on a trip to sf and used it both ways on the plane to watch movies i had downloaded and used it over the weekend while i was there and didn't have to charge it the whole time. i like that they moved away from the carousel and just have the app icons listed the way they are now. i have recommended this to a lot of my friends, especially the ones with kids.

games are excellent and great books to read as well	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought one of these for myself and another for my sister. overall i am very satisfied with my purchase, it's an overall good value. the os is very clean and simple to navigate and based on android. i was able to install the play store without rooting the device by simply installing the apks. overall it works great with amazon apps and those i've installed from the play store. the sound quality is fair though the one speaker is a little low at times. screen quality is good, not hd but decent. the most lackluster part of the tablet is the front facing vga and nonauto focus rear cam i was unable to scan some barcodes with the rear camera. however, at this price point you get a lot for your money. i especially like the amazon underground apps that are totally free and add to the value of the tablet.

i needed this for my two six year olds to be able to use during our drive to disney. you are unable to get most apps that are offered on itunes and android market so i returned.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

great performance for the money, however if you are looking to read in bright sunlight it is not ideal.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet isn't the brightest, lightest, fastest, thinnest tablet on the market, but i have amazon prime and it allows me to shop, do a little gaming, watch videos and movies, listen to music, read books, and browse the internet. i mean really, what else do you do with a tablet. more that satisfied.

great product for children at this price.makes good christmas gift	Apple Airpods Headphones
this 7 inch tablet exceeded my expectations and then some. i was apprehensive about having advertising on the wakeup screen, but with a simple swipe of the thumb it goes away with no waiting. it streams netflix and uv copies from flixster with zero lag and no buffering. expandable memory, micro sd. this is basically an android tablet, so if you have experience using that platform, you will have no trouble navigating the settings menu, etc. there is no google play store access, however, the amazon app store is available and is pretty impressive. the resolution of the screen is sharp and clear. one of my complaints with my old tablet was the visibilty when viewing at an angle, but this tablet does not have the same issue. all in all, this 50 tablet is the best value i have seen, as it outperforms the dual core 250 tablet i just replaced. if you are looking for a 7 inch tablet, you can not go wrong with this one.

i never thought i would buy a kindle fire but i had purchased prime and discovered to be part of their lending library you have to use an amazon product. well, lucky for me amazon had just released this 7"" fire. i purchased it thinking the worst that could happen is i would be out 50.00. well to my surprise the little tablet works very well. it is a perfect complement to the prime service and i have been very, very pleased. it is not a samsung or an ipad by no means but for what it can do it does it very well. i guess the best part to me like i said is it compliments the prime service beautifully. the o.s. system is almost flawless for watching videos or reading books or the internet. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is that it is not as good as the others overall but for 50.00 it is well worth it.

this is a very good starter tablet. we have purchased several others that did not perform as well. the noname brands do not have the clear display that this one does.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i was a little concerned about the advertised display resolution, but it's good enough for my uses. it's not as sharp as a lot of the other tablets on the market, but it only cost 50. that makes it so i'm not so concerned if it gets broken or lost. i've watched some videos on it and the display seems fine. mostly i use it to read emails and surf the web. as this is my first tablet, i'm still learning about its capabilities and limitations. i've taken only a few photos on it and it is not as sharp as a lot of other phonetablet cameras, but still serviceable.	27in FHD Monitor
i like this tablet very much. for the price i couldn't ask for more. very user friendly. very kid friendly too.	iPhone
i love this tablet. it works very well. i bought it because i love to read ebooks and read the bible app. having a 7"" screen makes this easy.as far as apps go, it has facebook, twitter, pinterest and tumblr available. it does not have instagram available in the app store. i knew that going into it, because i've owned kindle fire tablets in the past.this fire is so lightweight, and i love that. one tablet i owned previously was almost too heavy for my purse.this tablet has a browser, called the silk browser, and it works well, although i don't use it for that.when it comes to games, the appstore has most of all the popular ones like candy crush. pandora is also available.this fire is an excellent value for the money, and i truly mean that. perfect for kids too	ThinkPad Laptop
this is my first tablet and i love it!easy to understand and there are so many apps i read a sample book and i like the huge selection of books,newspapers and magazines the lighting is perfect easy on the eyes	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

the tablet works nice for reading and surfing the internet. it also has decent choice of games to download from amazon. it also plays video decent, but the resolution on the screen on the screen is a little lacking, it is not an ipad air, but as a basic tablet it functions well for the price.

this is my 3rd kindle and my 2nd kindle fire. i bought this fire because of the upgrade ability and my 1st fire didn't have that, before i bought my 1st kindle, i compared all my choices and found this one to be the best for the money and i love my kindle so much i bought on for my daughter , it has a lot more then the original fire did, more apps can be used, it connects to goodreads, if you do that, which i do, and it has a camera. it's more like a tablet than just only a ereader. a little different set up than the original fire but not that hard to get used to, buttons are bigger for the power and the volume, which is a plus.

this just a great tablet. a co_worker was saying that it is no as sophisticated as her 600 tablet and it isn't. but i can put one of these in every room in my house and still have money left over. this is one of the best 50 i ever spent.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchase for test because cost less than 50, work awesome, faster, easy to use and good product by the price.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i seem to enjoy this in most catagories. wasn't sure about the tall and narrow screen layout at first with reading books, but when placed side by side with old ereader, no strain to learn new layout. only thing not happy about is the lack of under 10 cases. not wanting to spend 25 and up for a 49 unit. i'm sure that will change. this is a real good product in a usually subpar price point. i think this will be a game changer.

bought this because my old galaxy tab 10 has become old and slow. very pleased with the fire tablet, quickly loaded books, magazine subscriptions and easily taps into my amazon prime subscription video and music. only reason it gets 4 stars versus 5 is the annoying ad on the lock screen although i'm sure that's why the device is so cheap.

this wasn't for me, but for a family member i have a kindle fire hdx for self. they very much appreciate having this as a replacement for another tablet, seems to work better lessno crashes, better battery compared to the older one not an amazon tablet. sideloaded texturenextissue as a way to get unlimited magazines can access subscription on several devices on this, and it works fine usually, but once had to clear app data.this tablet is not as highres as the hdx so tiny text isn't as clear as it could be without zooming but it's more than sharp enough for daily use, especially at this price range	Apple Airpods Headphones
i saw this item on amazon if i had ordered it from them i would had to wait 30 days. best buy had it in stock for the same price. having uses it for several weeks i found its a great small tablet for a great price. i plan to buy several more as stocking stuffer. for an entry level tablet you can't beat it.

i got this tablet to replace my kindle ereader. i was not disappointed, it's a great tablet to read books and comic books on. browsing the internet is ok on it, if that is what you want to do also. basic games work great, but if you want to play extensive 3d games, you might want to get a different tablet, you can't expect a 50 tablet to run any of those. overall, it's a great tablet for what i wanted it for.

bought this at best buy since i had a 10 reward coupon so only sent 40 for this tablet. short story this tablet can do everything your smart phone can do and i kinda like amazon's new os running on this tablet better than android, nice clean interface and very user friendly also like the way categories are on top and you can swipe right to view them. as far as speed is concern this tablet is good, you can jump from apps with ease although installing new apps are a bit slower than on android the apps have installed are facebook,linkedin, overdrive, cnn, pandora, pinterest, skpe all run fine. you can even run games on this 50 device, games like sky force, real racing 3 these game have high graphics run surprisingly smooth. videos on netflix, hbo now, pluto tv and youtube look great even though they are not hd. sound is just ok my smartphone sounds better and the display is good compared to other cheap tablets on the market that are not ips. battery life is good too, can go a couple of days without charging with just reading books, checking facebook, surf the web and gaming. already accidentally dropped my tablet on the floor with no damage at all.i not a prime member but purchase a lot from amazon so this device is convenient when ordering books and other items. this tablet has been rock solid for the week i have it and it's still shocking to me regarding the price with no compromise in quality. was going to buy the amazon fire hd but since my last 270 amazon tablet was lost this makes more sense since it's at a price point where you can easily replace it. amazon has really changed the game with this tablet, other's reviews that state that this is only for kids or beginner tablet owner's i disagree with. now for the people who must have the best tablet on the market looking at you apple ipad and samsung then this is not for you, but for others who need a device to do everyday task just like your smartphone then this is the one don't let the cheap price fool you.

apples oranges. they're both fruit, both tasty, but they are different at the same time.when thinking about the new 50 7"" fire tablet, keep in mind that this is not a highend samsung or ipad mini. it does a lot of the same things, but it's different. it costs a fraction of the cost. with that perspective in mind, this is a fantastic value. in fact, short of finding a nice, 2ndtier asus , lg, or lenovo tablet being pushed on discount sites, probably as refurbs, you're not going to find anything that comes close in value to this new fire tablet.prior to getting it, i had my concerns, particularly with the screen given the lower resolution. i have a dozen tablets, and have tried about a dozen others, and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on. amazon got this right. it is not as crisp as my older kindle fire hd 7"" or my galaxy note 8.0 or my ipad mini, but for casual reading, gaming, video viewing, email, etc., the screen is just fine. worlds beyond most lowendbudget tablets i've tried especially anything costing under 100 new. my daughter, who has been using a kindle fire hd 7"", has not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution.the new fire os operating system looks feels much more like android or ios, which is nice overall. it still is not perfect, but overall i think it makes for a much better user experience than the version on older kindle fire tablets.the 8gb of internal storage is, of course, paltry, but with the very welcome addition of a microsd slot, carrying loads of media with you for offline consumption is not an issue. what remains to be seen is how performance is impacted ifwhen the little bit of available internal storage gets filled with apps and other content. so far, this has not been a problem.the inclusion of both front and rearfacing cameras is a nice bonus. no, you're not going to capture great shots. but both cameras are usable and add value.the speakers are ok. volume and quality is not great, but is acceptable for general use and, of course, you can also use headphones or an external speaker to kick things up a notch or several notches.if you have 150 or more to spend on a tablet, and plan on using it quite a bit, then you can definitely find something a bit nicer. if you're getting this for just occasional use, or for a kid, and are not accustomed to using a highend tablet, then this is a fantastic buy. i've tested over 20 tablets and for a sub100 tablet, this is absolutely a great value. at its current price of 50, it's a nobrainer. kudos to amazon for raising the bar on budget tablets and making quality tablets available to the masses.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
best bang for the buck! although it may lack the processing power of the ipad mini, it has all the features and is 20 of the cost at 50.00. the battery lasts at least 5 hours of intense gameplay and video watching. i bought this primarily for my wife as a home entertainment device to replace her cell phone to watch video and check email, etc. she was not android savvy, but picked this up in a few days. i was very pleased to find it had bluetooth! the built in speaker is what you would expect, small, mono and tinny. although it isn't listed hd, at 7 inches an sd picture is razor sharp. colors are bright, and the unit is light. although you can't without a hack google it, wink wink get google play apps, the amazon underground has 10k free apps.you can also upgrade to 128 gb of external storage.won't give it five stars as the sound without external speakers or headphones is weak, and the speaker is placed on the back, but would say 4.5 stars.	ThinkPad Laptop
awesome only ga e four stars because in order to allow a child to use it you have to set a passwordpin. and ecah time that child goes to use it they would need to enter it. which would have been too much for the 5 yr old that i bought it for as a christmas gift.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

in the past i have avoided tablets at such a low price point, and while i was skeptical of this one as well it has been a great purchase. i use it for tasks i would normally do on my phone such as web browsing, streaming videos, reading, and android games. it performs all of these tasks admirably. battery is great as well. i can get up to 78 hours depending on the task at hand. it is small enough to always have with me typing this review on it now, yet large enough to give that real tablet feel as opposed to my phone. i have already purchased another for a friend. at this price you cannot go wrong!

the new amazon fire tablet is surprisingly good, especially for the price. the performance is good, the size is good, and the weight is good. the biggest new feature is the expandable memory slot, which is something new for this generation of fires.there are a few downside issues, however. first, the screen has splotchy illumination from the edge lighting. there are numerous lighthot spots around the edge, especially at the bottom where the menu bar is. after a while you get used to it, but compared to other higher priced tablets it's annoying.the software library is the second biggest issue. amazon has done a decent job in adding new software, but it's app store is nowhere near as robust as the google and apple stores.the last issue i have is the 90 day warranty, but that is how they keep the cost down.amazon developed the fire tablet to sell other amazon products, and this tablet seems to have hit a proper balance between that and usability. web browsing is much better than my first kindle fire, and i think better than browsing on an ipad. the app that surprised me the most is the email client, and how easy it is to use. in my opinion, it's a lot better than the native email client on the ipad, or a windows tablet.if the build quality as good as a ipad or samsung tablet? no, not even close, but for 50 it's pretty good device if you don't mind dots of light around the edge.

the fire works better than i expected. for a 50 tablet, i have to imagine it's the best on the market. good battery life, fast response and loading times, nice display. the only problem i've had so far is that i have to restart it if i let it sit for over an hour before it will handle a wifi signal.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a good basic tablet bought it for my 4 year old. only complaint is that it doesn't have one of the most popular games despicable me which my son loves so he still have to use mine for that. plz update software amazon!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
okay this tablet has its limits. it's not an ipad. but for 50 bucks it does a lot. if you have amazon prime it's awesome. if you don't, it's still nice. it's fast and has good battery life. you can side load apps if you can't find them in the amazon app store. overall i'm impressed with the features.	iPhone
this is great as a first tablet. it has amazon underground for free apps. the only thing missing is no google play store	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
for 50 i couldn't ask for more! aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books, i can listen to music, download apps, play games, watch videos, take photos record videos front rear facing camera, check emails, and surf the web. although you have to pay for most bookvideo purchases amazon also offers amazon prime for a month free 9.99 after which makes some purchases less expensive. you can also tack on kindle unlimited free 1st month, also 9.99 a month after to download up to 10 kindle unlimited books at a time. as for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads which is why this tablet is so cheap!. if this bothers you, you can remove the ads for 15 on amazon. the screencamera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price! the glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome, but i purchased an antiglare screen protector to resolve that issue. with the holidays approaching this is the perfect gift for those on a budget! this would have been the perfect gift for me, had i not already purchased it for myself!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought two of these for my children. they are not powerful, they do not have a bright screen, and the battery life is ok. but they are cheap options for kids to have tablets and helps keep down the fighting. app store is not good, but keeps kids entertained and that is why i bought these. great value for the price.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i always finding what i need and better customer service at the best buy	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great price point for tablet, has front back camera	Lightning Charging Cable
good product for the money. compared to earlier versions not as durable. the outside casing is plastic. not good. for the money good buy.	20in Monitor
got this tablet for my 5 year old works great even use it myself sometimes good for movies as well the only thing i don't like is too many adds on it can't take off unless you pay amazon for it	27in FHD Monitor
got 3 of them, great cost for what you get. my kids are down to only one left. killed 2 of them sadly. setting up can be a pain. kids keep asking to add more apps. you have to delete the old to add more. i'm starting to dislike them more then the kids like them.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought for my 8yo twins. they love it. games, camera, and videos. easy to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this tablet because it was so cheap! my husband loves it. it comes with many free games games that you'd have to pay for if you had an ipad.	ThinkPad Laptop
it works great i would definitely recommend it to a friend i would buy a few more if i had to but the price should drop down a little bit	Apple Airpods Headphones
there are some things i can't download. but, good.	Wired Headphones
i absolutely love my kindle fire. i received cash back for purchasing a new macbook pro retina laptop and purchased the kindle and cover jacket.	ThinkPad Laptop
it is easy to use, economical, and perfect in size for a college student, but isn't good for hd my daughter said.	Lightning Charging Cable
disappointed with this tablet. get one that uses android system, not amazon.	iPhone
this is my fifth kindle i have bought. i love them.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i wanted a tablet for my son to play games and read books. i didn't want to spend hundreds because he is only 8. this is perfect, i can put controls on what he views and password protect my control profile.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i was looking for an inexpensive tablet for my 8 year old, that he could use for educational games and just for the usual game play and this tablet has been perfect. battery life is good, speed is outstanding and you can't beat the price!	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this for my daughter for christmas, and she has used it for countless hours. she has a small crack on the screen, so i'd definitely get a case for it.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

it was a gift for my little sister, she seems to love it and it does everything that she needs it to do. no problems so far	Wired Headphones
fast up to 5 windows open without problemscamera not very good pics come out blurry	Flatscreen TV
picked up a tablet because my laptop is over 3 years old, does a good job, sound levels are good, nice picture for a non hd product. lots of pre installed apps and the ads on the sleep screen are annoying but for around 50 bucks not a bad product.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is the best tablet you can get under 50, i bought it for my daughter and she is quite happy with it. the last kindle i bought was kindle fire 1st gen refurbished for 100 which doesn't have camera or mic. so it was definitely a good upgrade for a very low price.	USB-C Charging Cable
the fire tablet is not only affordable, but a great piece of technology for choldren. the selection of books and games are very good.	Lightning Charging Cable
this tablet is amazingly awesome. it looks like its price, cheap, 39 at bestbuy but it does all that i need it to do which is streaming music and movies. you can setup multiple users including a child profile with parental control.	27in FHD Monitor
works great for a tablet and inexpensive. i got three in the past year and they all work great. i got them as gifts but i believe they don't have the same apps you can get through apple and google play. you may want to check that out if you are using it for those apps.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good product for 50. external sd card is nice option.	Wired Headphones
if you have prime it's great for the money. slow performance tho	AA Batteries (4-pack)
wanted a decent tablet for my teenage daughter without spending a lot. other then the ads on the lock screen the tablet is perfect for her needs. you can remove the ads which to me is worth it.	Lightning Charging Cable
the constant bombardment of ads when i turn on my tablet is not an experience that i enjoy. i would recommend you buy any other than one that runs the fire os. for the same price you can get a cheap android tablet and do a lot more with it.	Google Phone
did multiple reviews before purchasing this tablet for my daughter. very nice, works well and durable.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i have had some issues with this but not having a very helpful team to resolve issues. i work and go to school i don't have time after time to beg and plead to get fixed.	Flatscreen TV
i got this tablet for my kids to play anki overdrive, works flawlessly as host in multiplayer mode with ios and android devices!	20in Monitor
i would recomend this product to anybody kids and adults	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the fire tablet is awesome. i thoroughly enjoy the tablet. everyone should have this item.	Lightning Charging Cable
this item is very functional. i am beyond pleased.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i have purchased this item to give as gift. it works great for kids. i only wish it had few build in apps that a child could start using right away. anyhow, its great for kids, whether in us or anywhere in the world. i have definitely recommend this to all my friends and family.	27in FHD Monitor
just what you would expect from amazon. holds a charge well and does everything you would expect.	Lightning Charging Cable
purchased this to mainly read books after my nook died. can't beat the price, but the print quality isn't as good as some other tablets. it's more like black on grey as oppose to crisp white. it can be a little difficult to read from versus the higher price tablets.	Wired Headphones
its a great tablet, mostly use for web browsing and book reading. great value!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i like this one because it is easy to operator and the battery last a long time.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the new kindle may not have all the bells and whistles of previous models, but it is a great value for the price. durable and light, and with the addition of expandable memory, this new model works great and is very recommended.	Lightning Charging Cable
great purchase. bought for my two children. they love it	Wired Headphones
i got this because is difficult to not look at the price and jump on it, its a very basic tablet that can be use as a go to device on the go.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this device is truly a great purchases for me, as i want something very small for a recent travel trip i went on. it made everything simple.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
from the minute you turn it on there's advertising. the os is very different from a standard tablet os i couldn't get an app that i wanted from the google play store it just wouldn't work on this. as i said before, i found the amount of advertising just ridiculous.	Wired Headphones
purchased this tablet for my 6 year old. indeed it's user friendly with parental control.	Lightning Charging Cable
awesome product. got two of these for two kids! they really enjoy!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought the amazon fire for my granddaughter for her 8th birthday. she just loves it so much. she said it was the right size and everything. truly excited her, grandma gets an a! i would like to add that the 49 price tag for this high quality tablet can't be beat.	USB-C Charging Cable
the only thing that i didn't like was that i had to sign up with amazon prime in order for my son to get unlimited games. i ended up paying a little bit more.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great for my younger kids. my son is autistic. wtg	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i am extremely thrilled with my amazon fire tablet. it is definitely worth its price!	Apple Airpods Headphones
its a fast and reliable tablet once you get past thw advertising. you can pay to have them removed but if you could afford that mights as well get the one without the advertising.	Flatscreen TV
this purchase was a gift for 10 year old. today's technology enhances the youth of today. this tablet is definitely a winner.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
granddaughter loves it. she plays on it daily and downloads the games with no problem	Wired Headphones
this tablet runs great and looks nice. easy to use and get around in the menus , only problem i had was i couldn't get my pc to see the tablet to move my books to it.	Wired Headphones
perfect tablet not only for experienced users, but those that are not that tech savvy. my motherinlaw is really enjoying the ease of use of this tablet, it was a birthday gift. the quality of the build feels top notch. i need to get one of these to replace my aging tablet and utilize my prime membership to it's potential.	iPhone
my kids love there new tablets they were affordable and easy to use my kids love them	Wired Headphones
we bought this to download movies and books onto for a long plane ride. it worked great! very happy with the purchase.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
kids love being able to use this item as well! very good for their little hands to use.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love the kindle fire. this is my second i wore the first one out! i got it to read books and love that i can pack all my favorite books to go all in one small tablet! no more box of books to go camping! also the larger print is easier on my eyes and if i fall asleep ot shuts itself off.	USB-C Charging Cable
the tablet has been used for netflix a lot. i am an amazon prime member on a trial basis,so the uses for the tablet are numerous.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this amazon fire to replace the one i had. my old one need to have the power button replaced and the cost to do that was more than what i paid for the new one. i like that i can take pictures which i couldn't do with my old one and it feels lighter. i can read my books, check my email and surf the web. the only negative thing is that i still haven't figure out how to print from it. it was a lot easier from the old one. i'm still exploring all the apps that are preloaded.	Wired Headphones
love the size for reading and also for playing games online. tablet is fast to respond.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i purchased this product for my 8 yo for his birthday and it has been perfect!	Wired Headphones
i love my new fire. the only problem i have is putting it down when it's time to go to bed.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought a first generation kindle fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. it took a bit of a beating and i had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. i think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the fire hd 10 or something. so my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. i also use a surface pro tablet as my personalwork computer, so that too probably color my opinion. out of the box this is lighter than the original. upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. in terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. games i had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new fire. webbrowsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. in the end, if you want a good ereader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. if you're looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings.	USB-C Charging Cable
this kindle has good quality for the price i bought it for. it can basically do anything an ipad does, but it is a lot cheaper. if you want to buy your kid a device, i recommend this one because it's cheap and if it breaks then it wouldn't put a big dent in your pocket to buy a new one or you won't feel bad for spending your money on it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my son and granddaughter love them. clear screen and game play is great.	27in FHD Monitor
the screen is adequate and the service is reliable. i did not play with it much due to it being a gift. sadly the person it was purchased for was unable to hold onto it long enough to use it elderly lady. i still have it though, and it's a great little backup to my primary tablet.	Google Phone
i bought one and recommended this product also to my family and friends!	Wired Headphones
got it as a gift for my son to replace his old kindle.	Wired Headphones
very happy with this purchase. for the price you can not go wrong. i mainly use for reading so i am sure for a techy geek this would not work.	27in FHD Monitor
this is a good little device. well worth the money. facebook is hard to read but overall a good product.	Lightning Charging Cable
nothing is ever perfect. i'm sure my product has some flaws in it, which i'm okay with. as long as they don't effect the usage i'm happy. sometimes takes a second to register me pushing the letters, but nothing too big.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
initially i bought this for my son and he's been using it everyday with a protective cover since my purchase my only issue i have really with the unit is that the charging port is in a horrible position and it's very difficult to insert the charger easily i may have a defective unit which i may have to return since the charging port is quite loose the price was right but quality could be a little better	Wired Headphones
bought for my two grands to play games,etc. more affordable than an ipad for each.	Wired Headphones

nice tablet for the price, so far have run all my apps from amazon, the only does require is a better camera,	Lightning Charging Cable
this small little tablet is perfect for reading emails and playing computer games. it's light weight makes it easy to hold for even long periods of time. it's low price makes it affordable as a supplement to other tech items. i keep mine by my favorite chair.	Lightning Charging Cable
it's pretty good for the price! i bought mine for my kids to share and use.for this price, you may just want to buy one for each kid since mine tend to fight over it! the charging port on mine seems to not be working well have to push it up to connect properly, but the kids tend to just rip the power cord out without any care. you may not have the same problem.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is the little tablet that could!the price is a steal and the speed and function deliver. not a great camera but functional. not great for skyping but that aside a real bargain!	USB-C Charging Cable

it does what i need it to do and if very affordable	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it has a good sized screen. very good wifi receiver. overall good product.	27in FHD Monitor
i bought this tablet to use while i'm on the go. i am retired and have used a desktop my whole life. i have tried the apple ipad but did not want to spend the money as i have a desktop home. so this works just fine for limited use. i use google, surfing the internet when waiting for something away from home, etc. keep myself entertained!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this is a nice little tablet for many purposes. you can browse the net, play games with friends, map out your trips, or find a nice cozy little corner and read a book.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

the tablet doesn't have the best specs, but it was cheap and for my 3 year old. great product so far!	Apple Airpods Headphones
love the camera and many features! almost like having a laptop.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i read reviews before making a decision for my purchase, but ended up returning the device as i was expecting an experience like that of an android tablet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a great tablet for a very reasonable cost. the only place the ads show is on the home screen, once you open to the operating system the ads are gone. if you just want to surf the web, or do some reading this is the device for you.	LG Dryer
i had bought my girlfriend a kindle fire hd7 for valentines day. she had never owned a tablet or pc before, and was just a beginner at smart phones. she became a reader gobbling up over 100 books in the last year. this lower cost device compares well in some ways, but the screen on her fire hd7 is clearly superior. i would buy this again.	Wired Headphones
this is a great tablet to own if you use amazon apps for shopping,reading, videos and so forth. may at times be a little slow but other than that no problems	AA Batteries (4-pack)
could be faster, gets a little laggy sometimes, but for surfing the net, checking emails, games, books etc, its a great little tablet, and you can't beat the price	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i got the tablet for my two year old son and he loves his tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased for my son. he really likes it. it does everything i want it to do without offering too much access. the option to lock it down for a certain amount of time each day is something my wife and i love, so he doesn't overuse technology in lieu of other activities.	USB-C Charging Cable
the price is amazing for the product! works as well as any tablet, and is the perfect size for your hand bag. plus, if you are amazon prime member you can download movies to watch. awesome!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i am enjoying my kindle fire 8 gb ereader tablet. it has a good download speed when connected to wifi, and the touch screen is responsive. the only drawback is its inability to hold a charge for very long.	iPhone

this is the 2nd one our family has. perfect for kids games watching videos.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this was the 2nd fire i bought for my daughter after the 1st i purchased at christmas stopped working after only a couple of months, the screen froze up and would not ever reset and couldnt be saved, she does use it everyday so i guess we got our moneys worth of use out of it for the 50 dollar price tag	Apple Airpods Headphones
well for a tablet of this price so compact and complete is not much to ask for than just your self to use it to the maximum capacity.i love this kindell best product ever.	USB-C Charging Cable
picked up three of these for my kids to use. easy set up, works good, the only problem is the wifi is slow.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my 82 year old dad. it was to complicated for him to use. i couldn't figure enough of it out to be able to explain it all to him in the time i was visiting him. returned and bought a different kind.	Apple Airpods Headphones
purchased this for my mother for mother's day. it was very easy to set up and very easy for her to use. great buy and value.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
so i love my electronics. i have an ipad but when i saw this on sale i got myself one just to have since i am a prime member i figured i could use this too. the only thing i like about this is that you an expand the the storage. if the ipad had that option it would be amazing. so since i then expanded the memory i can have more movies to watch offline. camera is horrible, so i would say if you have a younger child, this may be decent but nothing compares to an ipad.	Lightning Charging Cable
my son love this tab and i recommend this. this is a great product.	Apple Airpods Headphones
awesome price for a great tablet.main use is for reading comics and internet browsing so there is nothing better i would ask for.good screen,easy set up	Lightning Charging Cable

great tablet plan on purchasing another . not slow happy with the speed	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet for a low price, it has a lot of bloatware but still worth it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this tablet for my soon to be 2 yr old. i wanted to download him some games and a couple apps to help him learn. he doesn't speak right now and uses sign language to communicate. this tablet works great. it's just his size, easy to use and paired with the soft foam carrying case i bought it from amazon it's the best thing i've done for him lately. would highly recommend for any and all ages.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i use it mostly for reading and it works well. i only wish that the camera was better but it is okay for that price.	Lightning Charging Cable
i don't have wi fi. so i can't use the device. i'm returning it. i wanted something that my father could use as an e reader. i thought i would be able to download books via my computer using the usb cable. you can't do this unless you are registered. you cannot register unless you have wi fi. amazon needs to fix this. this is a major flaw.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we love this thing! and for only 50! it works perfect for quick netflix	34in Ultrawide Monitor
didn't know you had to buy space and many other things for this item to work.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i was hesitant to get a tablet because i was unsure as to how it works and adding a new technology can sometimes be challenging. the best buy rep directed me to the amazon fire for it's ease of use and he was spot on. also, the email ""introducing"" me to my tablet was invaluable and helped me immensely. a nice addition to the helpfulness of staff at your store.	iPhone
great price and easy to use.wife loves it more than any other tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
my wife likes to websurf in bed and was using a 15"" notebook for years. found it to be very cumbersome and was looking for an alternative. tried out this amazon fire 7 figuring it would be adequate, but has exceeded expectations. seems quick with good screen resolution. only problem is doesn't always respond to finger or stylus swipe which seems common with most of these touch screens.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this reader is a great way at a low price to feed your newspaper habit. i save 50 per month on just one newspaper.	Wired Headphones
great device for children. impressed by the specs.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i got this for my mother for mother's day, and so far, she absolutely loves it. it's fast, great resolution, and i've yet to hear of any battery issues from her. i picked this one for the reasons i just listed in addition to the access to amazon underground free apps that normally cost with googly play apple stores, respectively.for those reasons, in addition to the price, you can't go wrong.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bought this after talking to a best buy employee advising i had to return the lenovo idea pad due to freezing up he suggested i get the kindle fire not too heavy to travel with can do just about everything i need it to. i was so happy with it when it was on sale last week got one for my daughter one for my boyfriend!

you get what you pay for. a small tablet, with ok specs. what was annoying about this tablet was the fact that you have to pay to remove ""offers."" you shouldn't have to pay to remove bloatware.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
a nice size tablet for a technically challenged adult. great for snapping pics, reading books and an occasional online search.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

the new kindle fires are amazingly good, the only thing that i have to say is the battery life is bad in it. other than that it is well worth it.	Apple Airpods Headphones

excellent product i use it for my kids all the time is great	Lightning Charging Cable
love the tablet, my 4 year old uses the tablet on a daily basis! perfect tablet for kids!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
when i first heard that amazon had released a budget tablet, i was skeptical on the price that quality would be sacraficed. boy did i have the wrong assumption, this product has exceeded my expectations and then some. the screen is responsive, the animation on screen is silky smooth when you zoom in on a picture or scroll up and down, it's just all out impressive. front facing camera too is kind of cool although the quality is not as good as the camera that is in the back. games play fine on this but you'll be wanting a memory card to store games on it. games play fine depending on what you install on it but some games suffer minor framerate issues if too much is happening on the screen. okay for the price, and this should be looked at before purchasing some of the other budget tablets.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great product for the price no known issues at the time!	USB-C Charging Cable
this is my 3rd kindle. i absolutely love it. the best feature i have found on it is the ""blueshade"" option, which changes the light levels for when reading at night. also you cannot beat the price. may be purchasing another one for my son in the near future!	Lightning Charging Cable
got the amazon fire tablet for my daughter n she loves it. it had some good games n learning stuff on it n she needs that at the age of 4.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
still exploring the possibilities. i bought it as a ""sort of"" addition to my kindle ereader. since i am not a total subscriber to the ""connected lifestyle"" i will be exploring capabilities slowly. my only complaint is the battery life is not by a factor of at least 50 as good as on my kindle ereader.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the downside is everytime i open up the tablet, there is an advertisement. i would prefer not to see these. font is changeable, brightness is adjustable.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

Apple Airpods Headphones
bought this as a giftt for my wife. she uses it mainly as a method of reading books and loves it. the memory is more than sufficient for normal usage and is expandable if needed. the fact that it is not hd does not matter to her but if you use it to watch a lot of movies, you might want to spend the extra 100 bucks and get the hd. jshe does watch netflix on it but usually watches movies on our big screen television. great buy for the money. she loves hers	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

the amazon fire is a perfect size for viewing videos, reading books and playing games. small enough to fit in a bag or purse.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the only thing i don't like is the power plug it sometimes don't want to charge	Lightning Charging Cable
bought the tablets for my kids. the tablet isn't really friendly for them. the home pages try to take you to amazon stuff only and when they download games it's kind of hard to find them. battery life can't hold up to a 5yr old. he runs it dead quicker then it can charge.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i need tablets that were cheap but had the processing speed that i needed to run certain apps. my children actually use them i bought two because they were so cheap and i have yet to have any problems. i love the individual profiles. initally i didn't have any parental setting on there but my son quickly started purchasing books and such that he liked with my money. hence the individual profiles and limited access and a password on my profile. i'd recommend this product because of the price and functionality of the product. i love it and my kids do too.	USB-C Charging Cable
i'm very happy i chose the amazon fire tablet. it's easy to use and i easily got the apps i needed.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this tablet thinking it will fill a void when my previous tablet was stolen, and it has done much more than i expected for it has apps no play store has, and amazon keeps me posted on any updated apps available for download through my email. i could not have purchased a better device for the price.	Macbook Pro Laptop
when i first got the tablet the screen was damaged, overall it's a decent tablet. its sorta slow, at the end of the day all i gotta say is only bruisers remain.	USB-C Charging Cable
i do love my amazon tablet. wish they had some apps that google play and apple have like kidstub. but other than that great tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i like the overall tablet. what i don't like is the constant ads that pop up because they want you to purchase whatever app you're using. kind of annoying.	Wired Headphones
this is a great product. easy to navigate and use with wifi.	Wired Headphones
this is the second one we have purchased and we really enjoy it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it was a great purchase and i love the way it works	Lightning Charging Cable
i wanted a small tablet to read news and watch videos. i have amazon prime, so i figured why not, it is really cheap. well, i believe you get what you pay for. this fire tablet froze on me, when i only had one thing open. i am very disappointed. it also is very slow when you rotate the screen. ugh! i will be returning it.

so far i like it, but wish the app store had the game i play. i haven't done anything else but read so can't comment on other things.	Lightning Charging Cable
this tablet is great for using ebooks as a college student	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my daughter for her 16th birthday and she likes it to ware her mind down at night. she made the comment that it great with the exception that its a bit slow, other than that it suits her needs.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days. i did not. so when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, i didn't rush to call. i have been taking care of seriously ill family members so i put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since i thought i had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which i didn't have. today my son was home sick, so i had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so i called amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps three times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only 49.99. ok. after i calmly explained to he that that was full price and i wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me 10 off my next purchase.moral of the story, know before you buy if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo i guess.also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect since it wasn't on the box i found the amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. keep that in mind.if 50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it?	Lightning Charging Cable
oh how i love this product. i spend hours playing solitaire, reading novels, listening to music all provided by my new kindle fire! i traded in my old kindle which i also loved but this new one is a little larger and has more features many of which i haven't used yet. i couldn't be more pleased!	Apple Airpods Headphones

it's great! the price is right. you can load lots of books and cloud is unlimited to keep your books	Wired Headphones
bought 2 of these so far and they work great for the price. buy a mini sd card with it because it only has 8gb onboard. this tablet is a good buy for your kids and you can enable parental controls if you choose to do so. i would recommend this tablet as a good buy. it's not the fastest thing around but it gets the job done. at 50 dollars you can break it and not care lol.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this reader is great for consuming your digital media on the go. with a few tweaks it is quite a function tablet for cheap.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this product is not just for reading books. it works just like a tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
i have bought 2 of these, one for my 4 yr old and one for my 6 yr old. both of them have previously broken tablets before. i am amazed how well these have stood up to them and how well they perform. a super deal for a tablet. i likely will buy another just for reading for myself since they're smaller and lighter and easier price wise to replace than my ipad. just a forewarning, the kindle store can be a little wonky and less streamlined in aligning purchases. i wish there was a restore purchases button like in the apple store since i've bought stuff in games to have the content disappear. i'm sure if i were less lazy i could call customer support though	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use and update. great for kids and adults alike.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought two for my kids they love them. great for the price.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought one of these for my father. he loves it and i noticed it is very well built like if it was built the same way as the amazon fire box which i am very impressed by how well built it is. even the battery terminals are polished chrome tabs. i mean come on what company goes to that much trouble. the charger reminded be of an iphone charger. impressed by this little tablet i will have to pick one up for myself now in the near future. good product for the buck!

if you are looking for a reader that is just a bit more than a reader this is the right product. i bought this for my wife so she would stop trying to read on her small phone, and she absolutely loves it. battery life is good, build quality is great, for the price there is really no comparison.	Lightning Charging Cable
my daughter bought a kindle fire when it cost 200 and thought it was a good deal for something that did so much. mine was only 50 at my local best buy, and it's truly a marvel i can watch tv and movies from my library, read books and emails, and order products. i can't imagine any more for any less. clear, bright colors, crisp lettering, although small i bought the 7inch screen.

i picked up the tablet black friday, intending it as a gift for my daughter. i knew beforehand that it had a crippled android os. i also knew that it wouldn't be top of the line for the price paid. however, for a sub hundred dollar tablet it is pretty good. after a little tweaking custom rom with a few kernel adjustments	Wired Headphones

i spend more money taking my family out to dinner for a night than i spent on this wonderful little thing. i picked up a rubber guard and screen protector from another big box retailer and have a perfect tablet for my twoyearold for less than 70 bucks. this tablet has a kids profile mode which makes it perfect for your little one but also all the apps and great amazon accessibility for the adults. i took a star off for the tiny amount of internal memory which gets used up extremely quickly so i would definitely recommend a micro sd card and making sure you change the settings to store your apps on the card and not be internal memory. otherwise no complaints and several places on the internet will tell you how to use another bigname app store to download your favorites.

i went from a paper white to the kindle fire and it's been great! it's easy to use and to read my books. lots of stuff you can do with this from watching movies to taking care of my email and facebook etc. all round easy to handle and is a nice computer tablet in the palm of my hands. i like the way the controls are at the top so i don't accidentally turn the power off in the middle of something when i was using other devices that had the on off button at the bottom. i just wish the power reserve would last as long as my kindle paper white. the battery runs down fester than i'd like.	iPhone

if it wasn't for my receiving an email advertisement from best buy's weekly deals, i would not have seen kindle fire on sale. i have been most pleased and satisfied with the product and the free shipping offer from best buy.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
slightly slow. however, really good for the price. also. these amazon tablets don't use the normal google app store. they use the amazon app store, which is not as extensive as the google app store. this can be a significant drawback.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my kids break stuff, not on purpose, but they break electronics. rather than spend hundreds on other tabletsthat might get broken, this kindle at this price was a no brainer. no bugs, simple menus, easy to use for kids 6.	Flatscreen TV

been reading reviews for months. i decided to take a chance when i saw this on sale for 10 off and i am glad i did. i love to read and reading is easy and relaxing, i dont have to worry about losing my place and amazon always offers up the next book in the series so i can continue reading with very little interruption. i know that some have complained about missing pixels on the screen, mine was just fine, maybe they have conquered the pixel problem. highly recommended.	20in Monitor

i needed a tablet to play games, watch movies and so on while traveling. i didn't want to spend a lot of money. this tablet meets my expectations.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this is what it has come to. you can now buy a quality tablet for 50. amazing! works well, just couple things. it uses amazon app store, not, google play store. it runs an os called fire 5.0, which is based on android os. so you may not find apps that are available the same as android. of course, all of the big name apps are there. but if you want to hold a good quality piece of hardware in your hands for not a lot of money, this is a great choice. amazon has a philosophy. they want to make money after the sale. so that's why they get you in at a low price. also, they have created a revenue stream by selling ads. when your screen times out, it will post a ""screen saverwallpaper"" that is an advertisement. if you want, you can go to your amazon account, pay a one time 15 fee per unit, not per account to get rid of them,	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought 2 tablets. one for my oldest daughter an then one for my husband. haven't had any issues with either. about to buy another one for my youngest now	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

easy to use, practical, bigger than a phone smaller than an ipadeasy on the eyes. the only draw back is the touch screen needs to be easier. one must tap harder to open the apps. otherwise very satisfied with this item	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the price is right for a kid's tablet. if they break it, i won't be very mad. it's easy to set parental controls too.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i bought the amazon fire with realistic expectations. i have an iphone se outstanding phone, so the intention was to be able to play some free games, view facebooketc on a slightly larger screen, some light web browsing, and maybe read an electronic book here and there. it has served this purpose with excellence so far. not the fastest tablet you'll ever find i'm sure, but no slowpoke either. and i would venture to say you will be hardpressed to find a better value for any piece of electronics at 50. highly recommended.	Google Phone
this tablet is excellent when you are an onthego person. you not only have the ability to access the internet, but you have the ability to read a good book as well. you will not have to lug a big book with you if youre out and about. i have never had a tablet where books can be downloaded onto it and its free. i am one satisfied customer!

great tablet but after about a year it starts acting up and you cannot get help from amazon to fix it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
if you have an amazon prime account, you should have a fire tablet. it is so easy to have kindle books, amazon music and videos at your finger tips. this is 34 or however much i paid well spent. now, what i don't like about the tablet is the operating system it is limiting. bottomline is if you need to do something other than use the amazon suite of features you will need another tablet. however, i have no problem with using this specifically for the amazon stuff and for managing my echo dot.

i really like the tablets. my grand kids enjoy them a lot.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i was skeptical about buying the fire at first because i didn't think i'd like it as much as a good old fashioned book, but books are expensive if you read as much and as fast as i do, so i caved and bought it. i am in love! it's super light weight and easy to navigate and i love that it has night settings to protect your eyes from the screen brightness. you also can use all of your social media and other apps on the tablet which is a major plus.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

this was a great price for a great tablet on black friday	Flatscreen TV
for an inexpensive black friday special, i have to say that i am quite impressed with this tablet. well worth the 33 price tag. the speakers leave a lot to be desired, but when used with an external speaker, it sounds great. the battery life is also impressive. i've been using it for 2 hours and the battery level is now at 54 remaining. i must admit that i was somewhat hesitant to purchase it, but i figured that for the price, i would give it a try. i am not sorry for my decision. i have another tablet that cost 5 times as much and there is no difference in the performance. even at the everyday price of 49, this tablet is worth the money.	Wired Headphones
this was bought for toys for tots. everyone always buys for the younger kids but forget that here are preteens and teenagers too!	20in Monitor

our son is loving his tablet. perfect size and cost.	Google Phone
i'm ambivalent about this tablet. it's a great price point and the picture quality is amazing. it's great for watching netflix. but, you are locked in to only the apps available on amazon. i can't download my browser if choice or even the google search app. additionally, the tablet is linked to amazon, and basically unusable if you don't have a valid amazon account, i bought an additional tablet for a non amazon person and they couldn't download any apps.

purchased this as a gift for a senior, very simple to use for her needs.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased the fire 7 almost one year ago. it is a very good tablet for the money. screen resolution isn't the best but is adequate. but at this price point i am not complaining. wifi seems to have slowed a bit since when it was new and i dont have many apps and i do clear the background tasks. that being said it is faster than my previous fire hd 2012 generation. cameras are so so but i don't use them often if at all. having the micro sd slot is great. amazon does a great job of automatically up dating the os. i just received the alexa update yesterday. pick this tablet up on black friday oor an even better deal!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
ouch. i bought this fire tablet, and used it for about four hours, and left it on a charger. a couple of hours later, i picked up the tablet, and the screen was showing a weird 'ghosting' effect, and then the screen went completely black.i twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again, just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tablet.i'm sure i had a defectivedamaged tablet, but i was underwhelmed with the quality, and it would be nice if amazon brought back the higher quality hdx tablets, for people who don't mind paying more for quality tablets.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love it. works great for what i purchased it for	34in Ultrawide Monitor
my special needs son frequently drops his tablet. this is a great low cost option when no protection case can hold him back.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
was about to purchase another tablet for more money else where when another shopper informed me of the kindle fire being available at best buys for 49. was able to purchase a name brand tablet for less. i was all in. going to best buys to make the purchase was well worth the trip and the price. the kindle fire has not let me down to date. i can read books, google, read my email and most things i can do on my computer.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is our fifth kindle in the family. i bought this one for my son to replace a similar one that stopped functioning after a few months. so far this one is working well. but just in case, i bought a one year warranty in case it fails.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

these tablets are a great value theyre perfect for kids or users who just want to browse the web, read, etc. they are not the most powerful but for the price they're an amazing deal.ps use a search engine and learn how to sideload android apps. the amazon store is a bit limited and missing some popular apps. sideloading removes that problem all together.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
got this for my daughter grandson for their birthday.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

we bought this as a birthday present for my 8 year old. it has almost everything she wants on it. only problem is amazon's app options are limited compared to apple or google play. other than that, she loves it.	Google Phone
works well for my children. they both have one and seems to run smoothly for the games and apps they use.	Lightning Charging Cable
for what the kindle fire does, at 50, it's practically a steal. the reason why i bought the fire was because it's excellent 'read aloud' function. there are many books that do not come in audiobook format, which i need i don't have as much time as i would like to sit down and read these days. the kindle fire has allowed me to finally get to these books, while i'm working out, or driving.good pointsit reads aloud very well, with several fairly natural sounding voices.amazon can convert most pdfs into a readable format, and you can change the speed. battery lasts pretty wellbad pointsthe fire's os could use some reworking switching bluetooth on and off isn't exactly convenient, being buried under a few menus, which don't seem to be customizable.all in all, it's a great buy at 50!	34in Ultrawide Monitor

it's alright personally the picture quality is pretty bad but i guess that's what you get for paying 50.	27in FHD Monitor

bought two kindle fires, one for my son and the other for my nephew, as christmas gifts. they were on sale for about 53.00 and i must say that it was very well worth it. the size, weight and portability is amazing. my boys get to watch all their favorite shows and take pictures. it keeps them busy while i get done housework. i'm extremely glad i chose the kindle fire and i would definitely buy again and recommend to a friend. fyi, my son is 6, my nephew is 3 years old.

this would be a great tablet even if it were 100. picking it up on black friday was literally a nobrainer. i saw it, looked at the price, picked it up and bought it. it is great for all age users. not great for graphically intense games, but if you want that you need to pay for it. for a casual, everyday tablet also great for watching movies on the go you can't beat it.	USB-C Charging Cable
we got this tablet for our son to use in school and it's perfect for just that. at the right price too.	Apple Airpods Headphones
good, inexpensive tablet for kids. it's nice being able to set up an account for kids that limits screen time. amazon's underground apps free apps and discounts on ebooks adds to the value.the only con is the limited builtin storage only 4gb free after you account for the system software, so an sd card is highly recommended.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was perfect for my 5 year old u can set it to their profile so they can't buy anything or access the app you don't want them too. best buy for kids who want a tablet!	USB-C Charging Cable

nice tablet for reading articles and downloading books. a downside is amazon limits some of the apps that are available. for the price it's a good buy for my purpose.	USB-C Charging Cable
the amazon fire is a great intro tablet. i got this for one of my youngest child so i could setup time locks for usage and other parental controls. if you want to use googles playstore on the device then you have to hack it on there as it is not available in current builds.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i had to go through 2 tablets before getting this one, which is the best that i have ever had.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
a very useful and easy to use tablet. i use it almost everyday.	Wired Headphones
i have two kindle fire tablets, both the 2012 and 2014 versions so i'm rather familiar with them and how they work. for my son's 7th birthday, he asked for a new tablet. he'd been using leap pads for the past few years, but was also used to using one of mine when needed. i debated back and forth between this version and the kids edition. in the end, i chose this one. in having a kids profile set up on the kindle, all autopay turned off, and being able to decide which apps i put onto his profile, i felt this was a better option. the tablet is quick, good size for his hands, and has enough memory for any of the apps and books i want to put on it for him. we found an awesome case to protect it. for the price, i don't think you could get any other tablet. i am very happy with my choice and will likely continue to choose kindle products.	ThinkPad Laptop
i needed a tablet for my kids and this was only 50 plus a memory card and they had so many games we were able to take a 17 hour road trip and they were entertained the entire time. as far as android tablets go, this one gives the most bang for the buck that i've ever seen.	USB-C Charging Cable
my grandchildren enjoy their fire. it is great for any educational problems	Wired Headphones
good product.	Flatscreen TV
i own 3 of these kindles, for my children who are young. they can take some wear and tear, but recently one of mine quit charging. the charger will no longer connect with the port inside the kindle. the kindle itself was working just fine, but since it can no longer be charged, it is no longer functioning. i am really disappointed, and plan on buying a replacement. my children love being able to play on the kindle and for the price you really can't beat the deal.

this is a great kindle for the price. i can take pics of my flowers and send them to my kids. i can download books and read anywhere. i can play games. i can look things up on the web. it's small enough to take any place i go.	USB-C Charging Cable
great bang for your bucks, thats the first thing that comes to your mind, when you hold the tablet. it feels solid, it works great and doesnt feel cheap at all. i have experience, number of low cost tablets and you feel them the moment you hold them, agree, you cannot compare to ipad mini or other comparable brand tablets. but at this price point, i am not at all hesitant to gift someone. i cant put my head around, how are they able to offer such great quality at this price, simply amazing!	iPhone

seems like a good value, though i'm not sure how much it allows amazon to spy on me. major problem, does not connect my wifi at home. my android and lap top connect and the fire connects elsewhere, not sure if it's a wifi problem or a fire problem. will contact amazon to see if they can tell. otherwise i would recommend.

great tablet for kids. also great for travel as you can expand the memory allowing you to store music, games, movies, etc. battery life is decent but doesn't charge back up very fast so that is one downside.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is not as cheap feeling as i thought it was going to be. it's definitely not in the ipad class but it's not bad for what it is. i ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. pros the screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and real racing 3 plays smoothly. cons the major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. when it arrived, it was showing 76 remaining. after less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. i just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. my ipad air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0. built in storage is not enough. yes you can get micro sd cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. also, you can not delete amazon apps without voiding the warranty. and unless i'm missing something, you can't move them either.so if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine.keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. but you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the ipad's. but to be fair, this is 110 the price of my ipad air 2 and 18 the cost of an ipad mini 4. but i don't believe it's meant to be a direct ipad competitor. because if it were, it would fail miserably.	Wired Headphones
what a great product for the . it does exactly what it needs to and then some.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought for kids and really they enjoying. size is small but compact for kids	USB-C Charging Cable
takes 30 minutes to connect to wifi and none of the apps work on it and i restored it 3 times already. big and bulky. you will be better to get the more expensive model	Lightning Charging Cable

the amazon fire 7 exceeded all expectations that i had for this device. it works great as an ereader, and is a functional tablet as well. you may not get the stunning resolution of an ipad or higher priced tablet, but it certainly gets the job done when watching videos or tv shows. amazon's app store is also better than expected. the expandable memory micro sd card is a huge plus for me also.	Lightning Charging Cable
great little tablet for light surfing and watching shows while cooking. would be better if had native support for google play store.	Wired Headphones

bought this for 4 year old to watch netflix and movies via google play.the entire user experience is amazoncentric. the os appears to be androidbased but is repackagedrebuilt as fireos. as a result this device does not have an android os userinterface.i was able to install the netflix app but i did not test it. you cannot load the google play app, which means that all the kid's movies i.e. toy story, etc that we intended to play are not available. for this reason alone the device is getting returned today.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this is a great tablet for the money. runs fast and works seamlessly with amazon prime membership. prime is not required to use this by the way. you will not be disappointed if you are looking for a tablet for entertainment. we havent tried to use this for business purposes though.	Vareebadd Phone
this tablet from amazon can do most things like the bigger more expensive tablets at a fraction of the cost. the two complaints i have with it which are minor is the camera is not very good especially in low light and the battery does not last as long as an ipads. other than that it has plenty of apps and things that it can do like netflix etc.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i didn't have any expectations before buying the fire tablet which may have been a good thing. with the discount offered over black friday, i just couldn't resist. well, i am totally amazed at how good it is, especially considering that it only cost me 33. i download ebooks from my library, surf the web, do my email so what is there not to like? sure, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of an ipad but, for me, it is the ideal portable internet device even better than my mobile phone.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great gift for those who read and also enjoy youtube	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i recently bought this on sale at best buy for 34 on black friday and couldn't be happier. while i wanted primarily an ereader which this does very well i also use my new 5th generation fire 8 for facebook, cnbc, fox, and cnn news updates, alexa queries, and occasional email. i added a 32gig micro disk and now store all my amazon ebooks on it and yes, you can save all your ebooks onto the micro disc. just read the documentation as it's easy to do. while the silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. i also added two security apps via the amazon app store to keep me protected. they seem to work well so far. the screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while i haven't downloaded any movies yet, i'm confident they will play well. i should also add that i had to separately download an update from amazon to install alexa. while doing i needed to call amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric, responsive, and helpful.

not as good as the higher end kindles, but nice product for the price point. if you're an avid reader, and especially if you are an amazon prime member then this product offers an incredibly great price for entry into the kindle reading products, especially now that there is amazon prime reading. for even more value and selection, join kindle unlimited. in short this little device and a prime account offer an incredible selection for countless hours of reading. i can't see how you can go wrong, unless you plan to watch videos and then i recommend one of the nicer kindles.maybe? this one can do the job, it's just an entry level, basic model but for reading, i don't believe you'll ever wish for more.

i picked this up on black friday and ended up returning it the following week. this may be greater for an ereader but can't replace a tablet for emails amazon shopping.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this and the kids version past christmas. its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books. don't waste money on this product. the kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps, when they work takes forever. when they do work, the kids enjoy them. so i consider it to be a hit and miss. i'll be canceling the subscription as soon as my free year is up. not wasting money on it.

until the tablet stopped being responsive, i spent many hours enjoying casino games. i used the tablet primarily for gaming but also i was able to get news on occasion.i bought the tablet because my laptop had ceased to function. if i don't get a new laptop, i will most likely get another tablet, perhaps an upgrade.

great easy to use great pictures great price. awesome	Google Phone
i'm not a huge fan of the modified android interface on this tablet, and it is far from the best tablet on the market. not even close. but i am giving it 5 stars based on its value. it is a very durable and functional tablet and includes a camera and a microsd slot for cheap, easy, expandable storage. throw in the excellent integration with the amazon ecosystem if you use that and you have a very worthwhile device. if you are not a big amazon user, i don't think it has as much to offer, but it is still nice for an ultralowbudget tablet.	iPhone
great tablet, perfect for my son. he can have all his games. great performance	Bose SoundSport Headphones

the tablet is not bad at all for the price i paid during black friday. the only issue for me is the occasional pausing during streaming on netflix	Lightning Charging Cable
good for the price. a very basic tablet with basic functionality	AA Batteries (4-pack)
nice and convenient tablet for kids! i like that it has parental control so parents can connell what the kids do and download on it. only downfall is you can't get all apps on these	USB-C Charging Cable
i have purchased numerous kindles and fire tablets for family and friends. they've all loved them. when they went on sale at christmas, i decided it was time to get myself one, after, of course, buying three for unsuspecting niece and nephews. i have an older ipad that i love and use but it is limited due to upgraded technology. this fire tablet is perfect to do all the things i could not do elsewhere. if you are an amazon prime member, you owe it to yourself to get one of these things.

this is another standard kindle color screen product that replaced our original kindle 7"". this one is much faster and has more access to apps, although they are all through the kindle store, not android app store. i couldn't for example use my mcafee antivirus. i had to use the one that amazon approved. over all, a very good upgrade.	Google Phone
it's for my kids so i didn't want to spend to much but they down load all the games they want and keeps them busy	USB-C Charging Cable
very useful and helpful techs at best buy. cost was average	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought it as a replacement for my son's tablet that got broken. he likes to watch kids youtube app in the evening when we are winding down but with amazon you cant get any youtube apps just some terrible knock offs which was the point for getting to begin with. the orice was great though!

can't beat the price on this tablet. have to a student in college and they love it for taking notes and movies.	Google Phone
great price, works well for what i needed. no need to spend hundreds on other tablets.	Wired Headphones
i was having issue with the wifi for my main laptop, so i needed something that i could check email and writer posts on. now i mostly use it to play games and watch shows through apps. with all of that, the battery only lasts for a little over 3 hours before it needs to be charged. the tiny charger that comes with it isn't that long, so don't expect to be able to do anything with the tablet while it's charging. so if you need or want something that's bigger than the average phone screen to watch movies, read and check email or read books, i think this is a good bet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this tablet for my child because he previously had one. not much storage and the cord strips easily.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

loved the amazon fire tablet. i bought it as a christmas present for my 4yo. i bought a case too because as you know kids tend do drop things. this tab was awesome because it linked up with my amazon account and i had control on what my child was viewing. i liked that the price was great and the product is durable. my son thinks it's awesome.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
my family has been enjoying amazon stuff more lately, and the kindle fire tablet is no exception! i haven't spent enough time on it to get what i need as efficiently as i can on my samsung galaxy tab 10.1, but my husband prefers it to his galaxy tab 8 currently in use by our 10yrold son. remotes are too complicated sometimes. our family joke anyway. but he'll sit down and browse the amazon content, get all the car stuff he enjoys reading, and i haven't heard a complaint or call for help. i haven't even heard any annoyedcaveman sounds! i like that the input for the charger is at the top of the tablet. may sound trivial, but my main complaint with both galaxy tabs is that the inputs are on the bottom, so they can't sit upright for use while being charged bottomportrait for the tab 8 and bottomlandscape for the tab 10.1 either way, it hinders function. functionality during charging isn't disturbed with the fire tablet. when i'm ready for a new tablet, i'll probably get the galaxy pro because it seems friendlier for bloggers, writers, etc. but the kindle works if you're not looking for something too complicated. pricepoint is great too.	Apple Airpods Headphones
you can keep watching your movie on the go if you have to leave the house.	20in Monitor

this is a great starter tablet. does all the basic things and is only 50. not gonna find a better one for this price. in this price range your not gonna find a faster one. get an sd card and you can put stuff on the card eliminating the one weak point of the tablet, only 8 gig of memory.

the product is good for children. the downside is, the tablet's charging port will get loose and not function anymore within the first month of use. if you plan on giving this to a child, make sure you take care of charging it for them, dont let them do it on their own, or they will most likely mess up the port even quicker as they are a bit careless.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
kids loved it would buy again good storage works well	Lightning Charging Cable

silk is painfully slow and doesn't work on many websites. had to install mozilla to use bestbuy.com ironically. i can't put in orders with silk the default fire browser. if using silk make sure to disable the caching to amazons servers. with caching on the browser is almost unusable.ads are really annoying only come on when you first turn it on but i don't even really notice what they are. usually things i'd never purchase like makeup i'm a guy or other junk. these make decent devices for the kids for playing games on too. this is not a quality device like a galaxy tab but for the price its good enough because you know they're going to break it at some point.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased this pad for my boys. it is an excellent pad for a great price. they use it for all the popular apps, along with their favorite games. sound, picture, and the touch screen are all great. i couldn't be happier with my choice. if your looking for a great pad at a great price, look no further, this is the pad!

i purchased this simply for reading kindle books. i was able to get it with a reward certificate for 40. it's biggest issue is glare, more so in the sunlight. i bought an antiglare screen protector and it made a huge difference, but it is still difficult to read in the sun. i'm still very happy with the product.

great tablet for the price if you are a user of amazon's services. plays movies, videos , music from amazon's prime service great. if you don't use these, it is an ok android tablet. does not support the google play store directly but can be sideloaded. not a great experience tho.

i was looking for a tablet that i could download movies on for my toddler to watch on long car rides. this kindle fire has great parental settings so i don't have to worry about my child accidentally buying things or seeing inappropriate content. this runs much cleaner and faster than older generation fires. i was a little taken back by the size since i have a much bigger one, but it'll work out great for what i wanted it for. i did notice i have 2 burnt out pixels, but they don't bother me enough to return or exchange.	USB-C Charging Cable
i got this for a friend an was very pleased. the fire tablet is awesome. it dose everything the kindle fire dose.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

our first one was defective but was replaced by amazon. our replacement works great.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i got mine for a month, and i mainly use it to read pdf documents from sd card or onedrive. the tablet is nothing like the reviews said. it freezes up every time i press ""home"" or go to the next page or even to close out. when i go on the internet, some pages do not load fully. 910 times only the 1st half of the page was loaded. i am very disappointed.	27in FHD Monitor

my daughter is away at school, and she uses this inexpensive amazon tablet, which she won't is should something happen to it, and it'll be easy to replace. it has all the functions she needs, though it doesn't support some apps, but it does support all the popular social media and has a decent camera. it's easy to use, big enough to read on, but it's not huge, and it's easy to hold, store and carry. my daughter enjoys the orange cover.	Wired Headphones
nephew loved to play games and listen to music. he never puts it down. very good buy.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
for 50 this is a fine tablet, however i bought a 64gb sd card to expand the storage, however i have found that a majority of apps are not able to be saved to the external card , nor can they save data to it for example netflix. so be warned that you will run out of space and consider the one with the larger internal storage.	Lightning Charging Cable
the tablet is as you would expect at the price point, nothing too exciting in terms of the tech. but, add a prime membership and this device really excels at giving you access to all the prime perks and adds another voice control point for alexa.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my son, and he ises it all the time.	Lightning Charging Cable

at sub 50, the kindle fire pretty much falls under disposable. that said it is a fantastic little tablet, good enough to do almost anything you would want to do.only downside is the mono speaker, it is a little of an issue when listening to music over the speakers. if wearing headphones, the sound quality is ok and you get stereo.	Lightning Charging Cable
the item that i needed was very good in value and easy to find in the store the cost was reasonable and exactly what i was looking for, which was what i needed for the new printer that i also purchased at best buy. thank you	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet! my fiancee uses it as an ereader for books she downloads from the library.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
very durable cover takes the abuse that a 3 year old gives it	Lightning Charging Cable
bought this to replace a previous tablet that died. popped in a 16 gb micro sd card to add memory. you need more, 8 gb is not much. this tablet throws plenty of marketing at you, but in exchange you get a lot of functionality for not much money i paid 40 plus tax. if you like intense gaming, you'll be disappointed i think, its not super powerful. true it cannot run android apps, but its an amazon product, so there are lots of apps out there. for my light weight needs, it works well.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
very compact and easy to use. i just wish it had google play store but amazon is still great.	Google Phone
it's nice to go out in the yard and check my online stuff but it's just too small.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

bought it on black friday sale. use it as a odb reader for car and reading books every once in a while, for 35 there's nothing wrong with it	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i got this for my husband because he only uses a tablet to read and occasionally look up items he's interested in on the web. it has been perfect for the light use he puts it to. he doesn't have a lot of knowledge about using computers etc. and this allows him to read, play simple games and check out guns and other things he's interested in without having to learn how to use anything more complicated.

i purchased this tablet as a christmas present when they were having a sale. it's a good, basic tablet that does everything you could want a tablet to do especially for the price i paid.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i don't really care about the built in amazon apps. i use this tablet for xfinity tv streaming and it works great. since it's amazon, i don't expect them to abandon updates like the cheap chinese tablets. it's not speedy fast, but for the money it is hard to beat.	Lightning Charging Cable

not the greatest small tablet and amazon does have it locked down pretty well but it functions.	iPhone
we wanted an inexpensive tablet for our 8 year old and this one is perfect. he can use it to read books and play games and it was very affordable.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this tablet because it seemed worth it for the price. however, it only lasted 6 months before the battery died and was not chargeable, regardless of troubleshooting and what cord or outlet i used.best buy said they couldn't do anything but said amazon could help me since it should be under warranty. i escalated multiple times with amazon and they refused to help me each time. so save your 49.99 and put it towards a good product.

this was a very nice unit and easy to use for kids. good value	Lightning Charging Cable
got one for my nephew. very easy setup and has a ton of games to download!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
its a great device i bought it for my great niece and she loves it	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for my elderly mother who had another tablet that broke. it was easy to set up. more importantly, it's easy for her to understand. i did have to create an amazon account for her just so i could download her favorite apps. the only challenge i had was she uses gmail for her email accounts. it took me a couple of tries to get her gmail into the stock email app. so far, she is happy as a lark with her new tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
can't go wrong at 40 to 50 bucks.i also have the 8 inch and prefer the 7 in the hand.i bought the eight for the extra ram 2gb instead of 1 but haven't seen any differences in the 7 or 8 while using it	AA Batteries (4-pack)
so here was my dilemma, i could buy a cheap tablet from a no name manufacturer and suffer lag time, battery problems, software problems and all the things the bad reviews said or i could buyon sale an amazon fire tablet and get a great screen, great battery life, alexa, wifi, access to my amazon prime goodies and an easy to us os.hmmmm, which way should i go? needless to say, thrilled with my fire tablet, use it all the time and wondering why anyone needs to spend more when this thing does so much for so little.

i bought 3 of these tablets for my nieces and i was a little worried about the quality because they were cheap. the quality is great and my nieces love them for playing games, watching videos, movies etc. turn out to be a great purchase.	USB-C Charging Cable

i bought one specifically to play music videos in my car with the bluetooth sinced to my stereo. it's awesome.	Lightning Charging Cable
i really like this product. it's easier to read when i'm eating because i don't have to hold a book and turn the pages. basically i have both hands to eat with and only need to tap the screen to turn the page. i will say though the battery seems to drain a lot faster when you are using the wifi and looking up books or just searching the web. that would be the only bad thing about it i would say. other than that it is an awesome purchase	USB-C Charging Cable
i really wanted a ""value"" item to load listen to audio books both while at home and on the road. this is perfect. so quick and easy to load books via an app or the free library app. pleasantly surprised.such a great little ""reader'.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

great device! quick, easy to use and a great value!	Lightning Charging Cable
yes it is heavy, bulky and the adds are annoying but for the price it is a great little tablet.	Wired Headphones
i have bought multiple fire tablets and will continue too. i would advise to get the protection plan for any problems and we have had a few. the tablets work good for the most part but i would upgrade the memory to 16 if you are going to play a lot of games.	20in Monitor
i bought this tablet for my 10 yo granddaughter and she loves it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
spending money on the cheaper one with ads is worth it. the ad only pops up when you first turn it on and that's it. have not had any issues with it in the few weeks we've had it.	USB-C Charging Cable

decent screen, kinda slow response on the touch screen.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
got this gift for my girlfriend daughter and she loves it good deal thanks	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a great low end tablet and it is sold at an amazing price.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i'd say for the price it was a decent tablet it did what i needed it to do but the support i'd say through the app side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. otherwise i used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. good for kids too both videos and games side. so i'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better.

i purchased this as a gift for my parents. it's easy for them to maneuver.	Wired Headphones

amazon replaced it as it had gray stripes and no picture on the screen. that one works so overall the fire was a good purchase. recommend a memory card, it does not hold much.	Macbook Pro Laptop
my students enjoy using this product for learning .	Apple Airpods Headphones
this tablet is a great value. tablets in this price range usually end up failing quickly, but this tablet has held up perfectly for almost a year now. the 8gb is somewhat small, but adding an sd card has helped with storage. the lack of google play is a nuisance as the app selection is more limited, but by adding aptoide, i was able to access many of the apps that are available in the play store, but not amazon.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i bought this mostly to read the walking dead comics on and a book here and there. it works great for that. a slightly bigger screen would be better for the comics, but bigger screens don't come for under 50. i can't speak to quality of video streaming or anything, but it performs well for reading.

had to replace my sons lenovo android tablet and at the same time renew the warranty. had a few options of brands to choose for the replacement. lots of family suggested the amazon even the best buy staff said it was the better choice not to mention the cheapest of the four brands to pick from. well set up was a disaster. i wasn't aware that this tablet let's you put up to four names under one amazon account, until after the initial account member name was completed. so now my 7 yr old has an amazon account. also didnt lime that i had to put in credit info for set up. and then had to go into settings to put a parental block on inapp purchases. too many ad pop ups and thats just while it is turning on. in not happy with this tablet . it automatically backs up photos and stuff to an icloud. i don't know what that is , how to access it, nor is there an icon on the screen for it. also lots of unnecessary pages and icons all over the screen that can't be changed. my other sons tablet is in need of replacement and warranty renewal. i will not be replacing his with this product.

very nice.some of the apps were hard to open at first.but had to play around with.love it now! would definitely buy more again.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i hadn't bought an ""updated"" kindle in quite a few years, so as the battery on my old one wasn't holding a charge very long, and searching or downloading anything became a halfday event, i felt it was time. so, off i went and purchased the latest 7"" screen kindle fire, and holey moley what difference. this new one is incredibly fast, has a beautiful picture, amazing capacity plus a sd slot for expansion, and a twoway camera to boot! i'm still learning all the new bells and whistles, but so far this has been great and looks like the beginning of a beautiful relationship!

got one for my kids and they love it! it was super easy to set what apps they could have access to and stream prime shows. not a huge fan of the amazon app store compared to my android phone.	LG Dryer
this tablet is your best deal for the money. since it uses an adaptation of andriod made by amazon, it is technically possible to install google play app store without routing the device, if you read a bit online, making this tablet probably your best buy if your budget is tight. absolutely recommended.

this tablet is great especially for a child. granddaughter is responsible but accidents do happen so i didn't want to buy her an ipad till i saw how she did with this. after playing with her fire and being able to download so many free games, she informed me that she does not need an ipad. needless to say she is very happy and so am i. i like that i could buy the smaller gb one since you can add an sd card to it, to increase the storage. this is really a great purchase.

got this tablet as a gift for my mom, who is 72 and is a little not used to high technology, so she uses this tablet mostly for facebook and reading an ebook. works fine, but if you are an user that likes high resolution screen, plenty of storage and fast processor, this is not your choice.good streaming can be done though.

bought one for my mom a few months ago so she could have a bigger screen than her phone . didn't want to spend too much since they are not big on any kind of electronic. does the job. good price for this product. bought a second one for my dad. only downfall is i couldn't remove all the pre installed apps on their home screen . besides that, pretty happy with this tablet.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this tablet on a discounted price as an alternative for rc tablet. the operating system is not good, very slow response, apps takes a lot of time to open. many of the apps like youtube is not made for fire os, so my little one has a difficult time handling it. after 2 months, i got him rc tablet.

my son had the original kindle fire. it was great! simple to use. it finally bit the dust. i bought a new one. they made it way to complicated. it is going back. the power button won't turn off. the notification box won't stay off the screen the apps wont run. they just keep loading.

bought this tablet for price and for a little kid using it so i wasn't expecting it to be a flag ship device but this really isn't the best. the amazon version of android really ruins things. you can't get the same apps that you would get from the android play store. many apps on this amazon app store are just not the same and the apps you do get are mainly made by others for ex youtube, someone basically made the website into an ""app"" but its 50 so its whatever	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this has a gift for my kids. they love their amazon fires. a few down sides with the internal memory and speakers. pretty weak in these areas. the memory and speakers definitely could use some upgrading. fortunately the device has a slot for memory cards and we can connect to a bluetooth speaker. to get the maximum use of the device you need amazon prime. compared to netflix, prime is very competitive.	iPhone
the kids love it they learn something every day i'm happy i bought it	Flatscreen TV

i purchased this after trying the insignia 8"" tablet which unfortunately had a charging problem. the graphics on this tablet are ok, though the contrast is not as good as the insignia's or other more expensive tabs.integration with amazon for reading is excellent. tablet is responsive and speedy. construction is sturdy and heavier than the insignia. the silk browser runs well for all the sites i visit.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love this tablet, and use it as an ereader mainly. i love how this is capable of reading my books to me if they're compatible. my favorite feature for sure! thay way i can listen while i'm cleaning the house and my kids love to listen to them too. it bluetooths to a bigger speaker without a problem. tactically the screen is so nice, i love the feel. the internet browser is a but clunky, so if thats your main desire. this may not be the best. i feel it does well for my needs. i have found most apps to suit my needs on the amazon app store.

i bought this kindle fire for my daughter for christmas, and she has completely enjoyed it. build quality seems good, and i have been impressed with how amazon has increased the functionality of its basic kindle fire over the iterations of this product i also own a first generation fire. it remains a very viable product and a joy to use.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

even with onky 8 gb it's pretty quick. only issue is downloading the free webroot. its not compatible	34in Ultrawide Monitor
at 50 it's worth getting if you have prime or just use amazon a lot. at 40 on sale right now it's a bargain. there's only one thing about it that's somewhat of a drawback not very good battery life. but keep it in an area with a strong wifi signal and use airplane mode when you don't need wifi, and you'll only have to charge it every night. seriouslyevery night.

great. works great for the kids to do their online homework.	ThinkPad Laptop
i bought 2 of these on black friday and these have to be one of the worst buys of my life! the screen saver can't be changed so my kids are forced to look at ads every time they want to use their tablet. apps are ok and to be honest i could have dealt with the ads but the final deal breaker for me is the sd card. i bought my kids sd cards so they can have more than 4 games and the tablet doesn't read it or something. it says sd card inserted but it won't download apps to the sd card!	27in FHD Monitor
bought for my nephew. he didn't know how to operate it. it is a little tricky. would not recommend for a child	Macbook Pro Laptop
kids absolutely loved this gift for christmas!	Lightning Charging Cable
well, a good table for under 50 it's not bad. i ended getting the toshiba 4k tv with builtin chromecast so i need an inexpensive table so i wouldn't use my phone. turns out that the tablet does have play store so i was unable to download google home. this tablet would be great for kids for a started tablet. you can also control how much time kids can spend on it. unfortunately it wasn't for since it didn't work for what i need.

great for ppl that use amazon and amazon products. the price was great to.	Lightning Charging Cable

readers are going to like this tablet that includes the kindle feature, it has basic tools like cameranot very good, calculator, calendar, and the amazon appstore. i didnt like that it doesnt include the google appstore, cause the amazon appstore doesnt have some of the apps i use the most on my cellphone. it is good for the price anyways.	27in FHD Monitor

being a dedicated apple user with an iphone, ipad mini, and macbook air, i didn't except to buy an android or fire which uses an os very built on android tablet. but with this fire tablet being sold for just 40 during the holidays, and some of the google apps i was most interested in play music offering different functionality on androidfire tablets than on ios devices, i thought i'd give it a try. after using it for 6 weeks, i can say the fire is easily worth more than 40. it looks great, works well, and is light and easy to handle. the downsides are that the os seems a little slower than ios on my ipad, and the wireless router doesn't seem to be as powerful.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i use it for reading and i love it! i could take it anywhere.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this item was for the kids for christmas. the amazon freetime feature with multiple child user profiles is a great way to help balance learning and productive time with their fun time.	Lightning Charging Cable

it's good for lil kids n small stuff . doesn't look very fast	Flatscreen TV
the tablet is good for a 12 year old, i got it for my niece for christmas and it will do what she wants,which is to play games and read books. amazon is a little annoying because she had a hard time downloading some of the movies, because it wasn't ""compatible"", which is dumb since its their tablet and their site she was getting them from.	Macbook Pro Laptop
this is a great little tablet. it is wonderful for reading, going online and using apps. the only reason i gave it four stars was because there are a few apps that my family enjoy using that cannot be downloaded onto this tablet. other then that you're definitely getting the most bang for your buck. the price just cannot be beat.

i bought three of these devices for my niece and nephews and my parents both have one and absolutely love them, so i decided to get one myself. this was my first personal foray into an android based device being a tried and true ios devotee, with a mac and ipad. i will say that for this price point and for what it was designed to do, the fire tablet is great. the os and processor make it a bit clunky and it's definitely not designed for high level graphics or photo editing, but for basic activities, it works great. i particularly like the easy to use and transport size. i still prefer to read on my kindle but i do read on here as well. if you are looking for a basic tablet to use for movies, music, reading and other media driven activities ideal for amazon prime members, this is perfect.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is the perfect size and very light weight. it is easy to set up and does everything i need it to do. having a camera is useful too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my son. he absolutely loves it. his purchase was mainly based on his friends having this model and being very pleased with it. he is very pleased with it.	Wired Headphones
i basically use it to read news articles and stories online. it works well for what i use it for.	Lightning Charging Cable
i have owned kindle's for many years and have always been very happy with their portability, performance and ease of use. the highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this kindle for my son. there are only two areas that i am very disappointed the first, in the parental control settings, in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless onetouch purchases and i mean oneeasy little touch i must set the controls either off or on. the problem with this is that he then has no internet access, or extremely limited access, so limited that he cannot access content i normally allow him to access.big problem. now amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases, there is a cancel button, but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited. this is an issue that i am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase. the second issue, amazon's kindle app store is weak. if you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device, such as facebook.a major app and a major downfall to kindle use. because of this last issue both my son and i have apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our kindle. all this being said however, my son and i both very much enjoy what the kindle's do have to offer, so they get a good rating because of this.however because of the issues i discussed it was difficult to choose between an average and good rating.

works for what hubby wanted it for. will recommend.	iPhone
bought this primarily to use as an ereader. got it on cyber monday so it was a pretty good deal. i live in the google ecosystem so i loaded it with the google apps after buying it. i pretty much ignore all the amazon stuff. if i want to use the internet i either use wifi or access it via using my phone as a hotspot. it is a decent size for reading, although i think i would have been better off with 16 gigs instead of 8 for storage. i have installed a 32gb micro sd card for extra storage.	Wired Headphones
this product is real bad from amazon. although i dont expect much from a cheap tablet however this was even below my expectations. its way slow to respond to anything or everything. my 3 year old goes after my ipad when i give him this.wont recommend to anyone.	Macbook Pro Laptop

within the low price range, this tablet is excellent for watching tv, movies or reading a book. pros very sharp display, fast screen response, fair speaker, low price.cons need adding memory in form of microsd cards and becoming an amazon prime member to make this tablet worthwhile.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
between my wife and i we have three apple ipads. i purchased the fire tablet for myself and one for my daughter. it is an entertainment device. you can serf, email, watch movies on line and it makes an awesome remote for my fire tv. it really pays off if you are an amazon prime member. it has a version of the amazon echo but not quite as the echo or echo dot. i love the fact that you can add a micro sd card to greatly enhance the storage. perhaps they can teach this process to apple. after using this i have to admit that i have purchased my last ipad.

this was my third fire 7"" 2015 to purchase. one for me and two for gifts. the apps in the amazon appstore are not a numerous as in other stores, but i've got email apps, games, office productivity, everything i ""need"". for a simple to use tablet it gets the job done very well. as an ebook reader it's great, but not outstanding. the screen is not as nice as higher end models, but for the price and quality this unit can not be beat! the speaker is mono and not as loud as nicer fire units, but again this is a sub 50 unit.i use mine daily for email, web, some simple games, i've even sideloaded a few apps that work great your mileage may vary.expect to like the unit for what it can do and you'll be happy. if you think this one is as good as a 150 tablet, well look elsewhere.all the sub 50 tablets i've seen out there can't hold a candle to this one's build quality and features.

it performed the way it said it would and more!awesome buy!	Apple Airpods Headphones

not a bad tablet but well worth the . the battery is horrible tho after about a year or so worth of use. it drops off quite a bit and the usb charging port has issues.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
good tablet to browse the web, good for a beginner	USB-C Charging Cable
i originally bought the tablet because i enjoy putting together jigsaw puzzles. not having time to do them at home, i found apps that i could use on the cell phone while on the train. but, anything more than 125 pieces was just too many for the screen. i've found that i can do 225 piece puzzles comfortably on the kindle and, for the amount of puzzles available and the time i can spend on them, that's good enough for me.but, the kindle offers so much more. there are other great games and puzzle apps from the app store plus there's a sixmonth ""free"" trial subscription to the washington post. you can go online via wifi and download books, read email, watch movies and videos, and surf the internet, just like on a regular computer.it's great fun!	Macbook Pro Laptop
very nice tablet for the price. only problem, it sort of ""ties"" you up to be an amazon subscriber for a fee, so beware of this	Flatscreen TV

fire is slow when surfing web. i am not used to amazon app store which is way inferior to apple store	Wired Headphones
this tablet is okay however the screen is too small and the wifi does not work well. the wifi turns off and i have to manually reset it over and over. the camera is nice however the resolution is not sharp enough for my needs. does not make sense why there is not a version without cameras with a bigger screen size.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet for the price. its very good for beginner.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

absolutely love my kindle fire. would buy for friends and family. it is the perfect combination of a tablet and ereader.	Lightning Charging Cable
the fire has a solid build, is not horribly slow, and has decent battery. its major flaw today is the screen, which is both low resolution and poor contrast, with weak viewing angles. it makes a fine cheap tablet to hand to some kids though. for the price, not bad.	Lightning Charging Cable
i can not believe how nice this fire is for the 33 i paid for it. i would not spend a lot of money on a expensive tablet when this one will do most everything the big dollar ones will do!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this has been user friendly for my dad, who is 78. always provides entertainment and meets his computer needs.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

bought this for my niece and it works great. access to all the apps she likes and easy to use.	USB-C Charging Cable
i decided i wanted to ""try"" a tablet for reading books and a little social media instead of using my phone all the time. i researched the fire 7 and fire hd 8 and settled on the 7 knowing that it is a low end device. the device is slick and easy to use, and the alexa integration is really cool. but ""it's a 50 tablet"". at times, the performance is awful slow. i suspect it is updating content, say on twitter or fb. my complaint is when it is doing this, there are no visuals to let you know it is busy. i finally got on amazon's chat feature, and several hours later, including several power cycles and a complete factory restore, the performance is the same. the reps at amazon tried their best and fwiw, i knew there was nothing they could do to speed it up before i contacted them, but i thought i would give it a try. so get this if you want, just be patient. remember, ""it's a 50 tablet"". if you want better performance, spend more .	Apple Airpods Headphones
i brought this tablet for my son for christmas and he loves it. i would definitely recommend this tablet as a starter tablet for younger kids.	Google Phone
it was really easy to setup for my kids and is a great size for them	Lightning Charging Cable
this is an easy to use tablet. it was easy to set up and easy for my 6 year old to use. i purchased one of the off brand tablets for my other kid and have had a lot of problems with the charging port. not with this tablet, worth a little extra money.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
bought this tablet for my nephew for christmas. he loves it!	Wired Headphones
i got this on a flash sale in at the moment and it was a great purchase. i didn't plan on getting one that day but i did and for 50 which i got it before it was totally worth it. i got a really nice blue colored amazon tablet and i am happy with that. i can read books on it and use it when someone else is using one of the more expensive tablet i just want to relax and read a book. it is also great for surfing internet you can play games on it as well. it is great for kids because it is sturdy even without a case it has still held up nicely .	27in FHD Monitor
tablet is modest for it's price. good for beginners.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

these made great christmas gifts for my family that isn't too tech savvy but they love them and use it frequently!	USB-C Charging Cable
gave this as a christmas gift to my uncle because he has been given other tablets that did perform as they advertised. i have asked him several time if he is still enjoying the fire and his answer has always been yes. i also purchased one for myself as well and it has continued to perform as well as it did on the first day i started it up. it is also a great tablet for someone who is a first time user of this type of technology. i would purchase another one should the need arise without giving it a second thought.	27in FHD Monitor

basic tablet that we got for our toddler. offers enough apps to keep her entertained and a low price point. if she breaks this i will not be too upset compared to other tablets.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the charging port. there is a small metal prong that lines up with the cable that can get bent if you do not plug it in very carefully. have had to send one back because it would no longer charge. otherwise great tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
this was actually my second purchase of this tablet. overall the finish is good everything works pretty fine. it has all of the amazon services that you need like kindle, amazon music. the touch screen still has some delay, however. once in a while they put it on sale for 30. if your not in a hurry, like if you already own a tablet and are not really in need of a second one, then you can wait because i believe at the price of 30, this tablet is unbeatable.	USB-C Charging Cable
easy to use for my mom and toddler. just like any kind of android device.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great for the kids to have and play games on. they want put it down.	Lightning Charging Cable

excellent amazon product perfect for my 4 year old, i put it into kids mode and she loved it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
for the price it's perfect. does all the basics well and if you break it you won't be heartbroken. well worth it.	Flatscreen TV
nice size. functions as expected. use it for reading books, email and a bit of web surfing. like that you can turn down the screen brightness for night reading. took off one star because it is tied to the amazon store for apps and you can't easily edit google docs spreadsheets as you can on an android tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

great purchase. it does everything as expected. very easy to setup.	iPhone
from the first time i used it, the pages kept freezing and didn't respond to touch commands. i had to turn it off and back on daily. i tried to get a replacement and was told they no longer have them and i'd have to pay 10. more for a newer model. i bought 2 1 as a gift. so far 1 works and 1 didn't.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for christmas 2015. after about 910 months the battery began to fail to hold a charge. while the first 9 months were good as many of the reviews here laud this tablet the 90 day warranty is disappointing from amazon. when i did have a different amazon device fail within the warranty period, their exchange was immediate and easy for a brand new device so the only warranty issue is with the length.i'd recommend it if you just want a cheap tablet to throw in your bag but otherwise it's just average.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the amazon fire '7 tablet was 33 on black friday. how could i not buy a name brand tablet for that little	27in FHD Monitor

there shouldnt be an 8 gig tablet. not enough internal memory. kindle fire tablets work on a modified android operating system. but other than that a good tablet for the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

works great as a movie player. all i use it for is watching movies on an airplane or at sea.	Wired Headphones
i purchased three of these tablets as christmas gifts for my kids. it was a great deal since best buy had them on sale for 33ea. they were very excited to get their own tablet. the 7 inch is a bit small for my taste, however, great for kids. the amazon service that provides ample apps for kids is a great deal since you can add up to four kids on one account.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought this for my 10 year old nephew for christmas. he uses it for kid games not true gaming. parental restrictionsblocks work well. he seems to love it. i think this is a perfect ""first"" tablet or nice tablet for an adult not needing all the bells and whistles of a more expensive one. it is smaller and easily carried so it is perfect for web surfing, reading books, and simple games. at this price point, i think it was a great purchase.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this as a gift for a special needs child, he was able to use mine with ease so i bought his his own. best buy carries amazing covers as well and he is now able to listen to music, learn colors and numbers, and access movies in a fun interactive way. this is an amazing purchase for the price.

if you want a tablet that is current and works well with the android platform and that you won't have a coronary when you kid drops on the floor, in the toilet, or anywhere then this is for you. we have 4 total and amazon service if you have any issues is second to none. they even replaced previous ones for free when the charging port got loose but it seems that is now a problem of the past.

i bought this tablet on black friday and it was on sale. it's incredibly slow, and the screen quality is mediocre. what bothered me the most were the ads on the tablet. i only really use it to watch netflix so it's fine, but don't expect anything above that to function well on this device.

thus device is so portable and works really well for what i want it to.	27in FHD Monitor
this tablet is perfect for kids and adults for me if i was the owner i wouldn't want a little bit more memory and ram but that's why i own a laptop now it has an interface that allows you to set up a profile for a kid individually that's what makes it perfect for kids and you control. it also has latest and greatest apps exc. it runs games ok but movies stream well and really for me this is great i have 4 girls from ages 10 to 4 and they all have something and this one is the best of all of them.

i like the tablet. it works really well. i ended up purchasing two, a black one for my wife and i to use and a blue one for our toddler son. so far so good. i did get free virus software with the tablet as part of a black friday deal but it doesn't seem compatible with the amazon fire although it's supposed to be. thus far that's the only downside.

the amazon fire is a good tablet for everyday use.	Flatscreen TV

i bought this when it was on sale for a christmas gift for a child in foster care. i think this is a great tablet for kids but wish there was more storage as you know with kids, they like to download stuff. it is a great first tablet for someone who is just getting started.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

it's good for the low cost. good one to gift. does the basic job.	Wired Headphones
amazon products amaze me for the value of what they are. this is no different. a great little 7 inch tablet where you can surf the web, watch movies, read books, or listen to music. only really works if you have amazon prime. this really unlocks the potential. to really unlock the potential you can also subscribe to kindle reading unlimited if you read a lot or have several people in the family that will also read. i actually opted to return this one to upgrade to the fire hd8 which was only about 20 more at the time and gives you a slightly bigger screen and hd resolution i love to stream movies.	Lightning Charging Cable
i didn't even know i wanted it until i was in line and saw it for 30. could pass it up! i think i paid more for the case for it. i gave it 1 less star because it doesn't have all of the apps and games i like. otherwise works great and u can use a memory card.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
good adorable tablet. don't have a bad thing to say about it. as long as you purchase a micro sd there is no issue with storage.	Lightning Charging Cable

my 3 youngest boys got these for christmas and love them!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent product.i have purchased several yes, children can break them if they try .i am sure there are limitations as it is an amazon product .5 stars .my family does all they want with theirs, and are very happy we have 4.mine is a year old and works like new. i believe a previous model had an issue with the power cord they fixed	ThinkPad Laptop
very good tablet, the price is worth, you have and the price and quality in the same product.	Lightning Charging Cable
the screen quality is excellent, and while not all android apps are available for the fire, a vast number are. the batter life is very good and the responsiveness for the apps that i use is wonderful. my number one negative is it's continued use of the old industry standard usb cord and socket for charging. my wife often uses the tablet while it is plugged in, which leads to damage to the socket and the connector. this intern will lead to a third rate connection and the eventual inability to charge the device. i'm hoping that the new standard usb c will fix this problem in the future. for now, don't use the tablet or any tablet while it is plugged in!	Wired Headphones
my boys absolutely love being able to do abc mouse on here and i feel this was one of my greatest purchases	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a very well made tablet. if you can deal with the amazon pre loaded apps, it is very fast. simple to use and the best tablet for the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
the screen resolution, ease of use, and access to apps, books, and movies makes the kindle fire hard to beat. this is the 5th kindle we've purchased big family over the past several years have been happy with each one.	27in FHD Monitor
this a nice little tablet although i only have used it very little. i bought it for a backup, because we all know sooner or later ones going to break down. for the price you can't beat it. next year i may buy more than one.	Lightning Charging Cable

it's a cheap tablet that you can just give to your kids or whatever. the ads are annoying but then again you can't expect too much with the price point. however, i would not recommend using this for any kind of work at all because it's very slow and finicky at times but if you're tired of giving your kids your phonetablet this is the product for you. just make sure you take off your payment info, maybe even make their own personal amazon account.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i had the first gen kindle and this is soooo much better. screen looks better, the front and back camera is cool, the side control buttons are convenient and so far the tablet works great. it was an easy setup and transfer from my amazon acct. i bought it originally for my 4 yr old so the parental controls are great too.

my grandkids love their kindle! it offers so much for learning youtube etc	Lightning Charging Cable
excellent tab originally struggled to get it into the web but discovered that we have to connect to hot spot from mobile phone not open wifi in public place!	Wired Headphones
in my personal opinion, this product would be unable to satisify any adult, whether it was for business or pleasure. limited apps, limited space, slow uploading, etc. also, due to this being an amazon product, many apps and options are unavailable, that are commonly used with both android and apple products. so i would not recommend to anyone.

nice, clear images, but very slow and the ads on the start screen are annoying. also, the search engine, silk, is not very good. switch to google if you can. should have just stuck with the digiland tableta lot more bang for the buck.	iPhone

the fire tab 7 is one of our favorite tablets, and you can increase storage by adding an sd card. no reason not to get one unless you don't like saving money.	20in Monitor
the screen resolution is quite sharp vivid, and the battery lasts a long time, but i found a major drawback in a sense, it's like being confined to an amazon playground. big, yes, but accessing the bigger outside world can be a challenge. i often get sidetracked to amazonauthorized playthings, and getting around them, while doable, well, they don't make it easy. the only key is stubborn persistence.

i was expecting a tablet good enough for the kids to play and download games, and i was told at bb that this product would work for these basic needs. it seems like everything i download needs to be through my amazon account, very few items are for free, and everything takes forever to download andor open. wish i could return it!

my only complaint is that the charger does not fit in snugly to the device and i have replaced several devices as i could not get it to charge. they should take a look at apple products and how they are constructed.	Lightning Charging Cable
this was a gift for some kids in my family. great tablet for reading and playing gamesapps.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this amazon fire product for me to perform a basic web search, reading, and watch video online. it is a good product however it does not have enough space to store videos.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought 7"" kindle fire for my daughter to surf the web and watch videos. bought 32gb microsd card, loaded videos and install apps there as the device only has 8gb ram internal. this kindle has a known issue with not recognizing the microsd card sometimes, which requires pulling the tablet out of the dropproof case a pain, removing and reinserting the sd card until the tablet recognizes it. time consuming and frustrating. amazon doesn't seem too concerned with fixing this issue. it's minor really. video playback is fine, but web surfing on the child's profile for educational sites is slowsluggish. not a fan of amazon's ads all over the place and their app store is limited. for the price, hard to ask a lot. it'll serve it's purpose.	Wired Headphones
onsale is 39.99 is cheap , good for new stars tablet	Apple Airpods Headphones
these are great tablets for anyone wanting to get into the tablet game. a friendly ui for just about anyone. not to mention, for the price and being able to add an sd card for additional memory, makes this a great tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

very satisfied with it as wellbas the serv8ce received form sale person	Lightning Charging Cable
so, i won't be able to go into super depth for this. i only needed a device to run one app. for my purposes, it literally has one job.i can say, for the price, it's far more responsive that i would have ever guessed. and the screen clarity is great. good battery life.i was disappointed that the lock screen would always show ads. i don't have the package, and i don't recall it being forward with this fact. in the settings, i said i had to pay 15 to disable ads because ""in exchange for the subsidized price, they can do ads"" or something like that.i kinda get that, and for most people this may not be a big deal. but for my reasons, this is a bit unprofessional to have. so when buying it, whatever the price, you may have to shell out 15 more.still, all said and done, good price for simple needs.

love the tablet! got it for my niece and nephew! great for beginners!	Wired Headphones
i bought my wife the fire when they first came out a couple of years ago. she found it difficult to use and passed it onto our youngest son. he showed her all the features and when the latest fire came out, he bought one, showed us all it had to offer, she bought me one for father's day, and then she bought herself one. my son helped us set it up and showed us how to use all the featured it offered. we love it. we take it everywhere, especially in our travels. it is offered at a great price and i purchased two more for christmas gifts along with the cases.love them.	Apple Airpods Headphones
since this is an android 5 based tablet, i sideloaded a few necessary apps to allow it to be used essentially the same as an android tablet, with google play store, etc. the screen resolution, speaker, ram are just only adequate. otherwise, a good cheap tablet. really need to ponder its utility before buying it.

there is not enough battery life to read comfortably. 7 hours, maybe.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
happy with purchase at sale price. wouldn't have bought at full price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

bought this tablet on black friday for a little bit of a deal and it was too good to pass up. i don't use it as much as i thought i would but it's still really fun and easy to use. there is an advertisement on the lock screen but i'm willing to deal with it for the price. battery life lasts a while and it's fairly easy to use and understand.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
easy to use light weight, i love the games it has.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is my second tablet, my daughter love it, just the perfect gift.	Lightning Charging Cable
im an amazon fan so it was an easy decision to buy. good battery life for music, movies and general web stuff. fits my hand size well. powers up quick. screen brightness adjusts to any conditions. i would recommend buying in store cause i had to return 2 of them with a dead pixel. the one i have now has been good for several months.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet was bought to replace my kindle fire that had lost its video. i haven't used it a lot yet, but what i've done seems to work good. 8gb of internal storage and up to 128gb additional with a sd card gives you plenty of room for pictures,games, ebooks or videos. i will probably rate it higher once i've used it more.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the product would be great if it was easier to find the setting icon and if amazon wouldn't charge you a 1 for downloading applications that are labeled ""free."" the one dollar is automatically charged by amazon but you can dispute it with your credit company.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought for my wife as a stocking stuffer. got for a great price after black friday. she absolutely loves it. i have the older version of this and this version is way better	Google Phone

i have an amazon kindle and this one. the kindle from best buy comes with some features that the amazon kindle doesn't have or offer like screensavers.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
cheap device running amazon's os. no problems installing apps or using the device. highly recommend for 49.99 or 33.33 during black friday.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this for my mum and she wanted it to watch movies in bed or download a book. it works well for this, but a manual would have been a boon as she is older and not tech savvy. it's not always easy or convenient for an older person to use new tech without a struggle. this wasn't too bad in the end, and she is enjoying it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
a lot of apps are incomplete. doesn't run apps that great and has a lot of apps that are generic.	ThinkPad Laptop

a great tablet for a good price, it has the basics, works great for a child preferably.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my son loves his kindle. loves the layout of software. easy to download apps. user friendly interface. bought the 8gb storage but bought expandable external storage to make it more robust. very durable. love the child settings to limit use when necessary.	Wired Headphones
at the price of 39 you can't go wrong. great mobile device that is bigger than trying to use phone.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought this device to stream netflix, amazon prime, and to play downloaded content. for that purpose it is sufficient. i wouldn't use a fire tablet as a productivity device as it is seriously underpowered. fire tablet bogged down pretty quickly when i attempted to multitask. bottomline, this is not an ipad replacement particularly if you like to do a variety of things on your tablet. but at 33 on sale, this was a very good deal for my purposes.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
love my purchases and you should get one as well love it	USB-C Charging Cable
my child loves it workes flawlessly and does everything she like to do	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i purchased the tablet for my christmas angel. he loved the tablet and case.	27in FHD Monitor
i picked up three of these during the holiday sales as gifts for family members. we have many kindles that we use daily the last few years and been satisfied will all of them and amazon offers all the content you could need for a base tablet. great for adults or the kids with a proper protective case. books, video, music, and games.performs well on all. the only con i can think of is amazon is a little weak in the app variety department, nowhere near the offering of itunes but for the price and performance, this tablet can't be beat.	USB-C Charging Cable
works great! my brother loved it. it's easy to use!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
got for my 8 year old. the parental controls are nice. i wish the netflix app was registered as ""video"", so i could give him 30 minutes of games and 30 minutes of video. i'm sure this works with purchased videos, maybe prime, but not netflix. he star wars commander, netflix, and reads books. it's a good size for little hands. it's great that as the parent, i can buy a book or game, and all devices can use it, even with each other if it's a multiplayer game. i bought a cheap case elsewhere that also props it up for handsfree video watching.	27in FHD Monitor
we purchased this tablet for my daughter for christmas. she is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. for 39 i couldn't beat that. especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an ipad!this tablet uses fireos, which is amazon's customized version of android. typically when i look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla android will make me deduct ratings. the parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. this tablet has the best parental controls i have ever seen! in addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. all in all this is a win win!the thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. with that being said, i have used android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! my wife has an insignia tablet that cost 70. it has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. when it dies it will probably be replaced by an amazon fire tablet!keep in mind, amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. there are separate home screens for various types of content that amazon delivers. your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. from what i see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. the nice thing about the amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. they maintain apps for android, ios, roku, windows, macos, and so on. also, their app store is not as extensive as the google play store, so i may end up doing some side loading. that isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.so in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. i would bump up to the fire hd8 for the extra features if buying for myself. however if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! my twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!	iPhone

i purchase a fire after my nook died. i had problems with the first one saying i was connected to the web , but not being able to connect. took it back and the geek squad looked at it and after trouble shooting for a while, they decided there was something wrong with it, so i exchanged it for another one. we set it up and it worked initially, then i went home and the same thing happened as with tg first one. so i took it back and got my full refund . while not happy with product, best buy customer service made me happy.

i purchased this as a drawing for my business. everyone was very excited about the prize.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i like the reader, nice and small. what i don't like is if you have a very secure wifi system at home, it does not let you set it up. i had to go to my daughters house and set it up. that is a bit alarming. it should be more secure since the only way we can put items on there is by putting our information on it that can be compromised. make it more secure and easy to put protection on it. that is the only reason i didn't make it a 5 star product.	LG Dryer
i purchased 2 i share one with 2 small children also purchased an sd card games shows movies books galore the expandable memory is the best	Wired Headphones
works great, he can enjoy his apps without interruption. now we just need one for his younger brother since the only negative thing is that he wants to take it away every day.	USB-C Charging Cable
i paid about 33 less than the going price for this. i can't complain for any reason on this based on what was paid. is it the perfect tablet, well, there are some limitations, however, i've paid far more in the past for comparable tablets that didn't offer any more than this. i picked up multiple ones and they are scattered through the house and all being put to use.	Wired Headphones
it's a decent quality tablet for the money. one complaint is the speakers are weak. have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback. the silk browser seems to have issues with search engines. just switching the search engine fixes it though.i got this for when the power goes out at my house. it's served to let me watch netflix. with a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.video quality is good enough. though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. i'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. he commented that the quality looked good. another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. no clash royale. which is the only mobile game i actually enjoy. i'm sure there's a way around this. but i'm really not interested in digging around for it. so for the most part it's a good solid low end tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i wanted a cheap tablet to watch movies on. it streams all apps well netflix, youtube, and others. the only complaint is the internet browser is garbage. i also have a fire tv and 2 fire sticks. amazon products work well.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

for under fifty dollars this little , durable , expandable tablet can't be beat!	USB-C Charging Cable
i've found this to be an excellent tablet for children for the following reasonsfree time unlimited you can create individual profiles for up to five children, and they can have access to a wide assortment of age appropriate apps, videos, and books. if you purchase the kid's bundle a year of free time unlimited is included with the tablet along with a shock absofbing case.price performance you get a relatively powerful tablet for the 49.00 price tag. if you subscribe to amazon prime this tablet becomes a great travel companion. prime allows you to download movies and tv episodes to your tablet for later viewing. this is a handy feature for me since i travel for work, and spend a good deal of time on planes. cons the only drawback i've found is the web browser. it's not supported on in flight wifi, but the ability to download from prime for later viewing balances that out. i will experiment with sideloading chrome and see if it works.

i bought this tablet for my son. he used it for mainly games. i though he would like reading his books on it but he prefers the actual book vs digital books. it works great, fast, and vibrant colors. i play with it on occasion. it fits in my hand at night and it's larger than my phone but not as expensive as other tablets. all in all it was worth the money.	Wired Headphones
i purchased the fire tablet with expectations of a average performing tablet at best. i was surprised to see that the tablet performed way better than expected and is still doing so. i would recommend this tablet to anyone that wants a good performing tablet without a hd screen.	20in Monitor
i was pleasantly surprised that i have enjoyed the kindle fire. this was my first ever use of buying books on kindle due to summer courses i was taking at the time in mayjune 2016. what i liked kindle books synched on macbook and fire tablet very helpful when it came time to write my papers. the highlights i made while i read the book on the tablet synched to the version i read on the macbook desktop. this helped a ton, especially with things like formatting the footnotes. watching videos cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen. amazon shopping i can now understand people's amazon shopping addictions.l i will give it to amazon, this tablet became my gateway to using prime and countless hours of online browsing. prior to this i rarely purchase items online, i can see how they have made it so easy across platforms. portability i like that i will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone. what i did not like signon screen adsthere is no way to turn them off. i suppose for 3949 depending if you purchased on a sale, the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet. however, i wished this was stated as a ""feature"" before purchasing it, i may have paid the money and upgraded to the next kindle if i had known it could not be turned off. turning offstandby mode this took some time to get used to rather than an issue. when you turn the tablet off, it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain. you have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned off. weather app i don't know if this is just my tablet, the weather app does not update as soon as you open it. it takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather. i have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue. i have instead downloaded and used other weather apps. but at this point the app is worthless. screen resolution it's not the best, but i got used to it. for reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient. screen dimmerblue light mode i read and use the tablet at night, and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen. and the system's default dimmer and blue light feature is awful. the blue light app allows you to set the color tone however, it is so orange it makes it unreadable. the app i use instead is called bluelight blocking. and even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me. so i have had to download the app dimly so be able to set the brightness.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
whether you're a beginner or an expert, this tablet will appeal to you! easy to understand tutorials, smooth animations, and more user friendly than android or apple products and yes i own some of samsung's and apple's latest mobile devices 49 is an amazing price! best worth per dollar spent!

not the best and the brightest in the market. bought two of them and one got damaged within the second month. best buy was not taking it back and amazon asked a price of a whole new one for repair. good price though but high possibility that the product might not last too long.

this 7 inch tablet has just enough power to let you do your daily tasks, it's touchscreen is fantastic with a decent display resolution. it will give you everything that you will need from a good tablet. the only downside is the camera. i wish the front camera should have been of attest of one mega pixel.

got this for mom to replace an aging ipod she was using. she is reluctant to adopt any new technology but i have loaded all of her apps and saw her on occasion slowly warming up to the device. the only issue i have with amazon fire devices is that not all google play store apps can be installed. for example you cannot have access to google hangouts which mom would like to use. anyhow it is a good overall device for people who are starting to use new tech items.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought it for my granddaughter. she had an older kendal which she gave to her younger brother but not a amazon fire 7"" tablet. she loves it.	USB-C Charging Cable
price is nice but performance was not. sluggish to the point of frustration even to my 4 year old. would be fine as ereader or maybe basic web device.	Lightning Charging Cable
nice kids tablet for a decent price. i bought it for a road trip.	USB-C Charging Cable
the amazon fire is a great tablet with many free apps for kids. i set parental controls to prevent internet access. my only issue is that the amazon app store doesn't offer the youtube kids app. other than that he's had the the tablet for about 4 mths we've had no issues.	Lightning Charging Cable
don't like that amazon has so many ads going on this thing. makes it pretty not fun to use.	Lightning Charging Cable

this tablet gets the job done! it is a 50 dollar tablet, so know it is limited in what it can do. it does what i purchased it to do. basically read email, watch videos and to do social media. you shouldn't compare it to a higher end tablet. not the same! you'll have no complaints if you know going into purchasing, you get what the price reflects!

i bought this for my mom and she loves it. she had been using a kindle in the past and needed something new.	USB-C Charging Cable
very satisfied with the product, i have one for each of my kids now and for that the price point is amazing. i have a pretty big beef with best buys in store customer service at this point, i ordered a different color to help keep my kids kindles separated between them. the color i ordered for my 6 year old came in but they sent the 16 gig rather than the 8 gig. instead of giving me the color my 6 year old ordered the customer service agent behind the counter absolutely insisted that they couldn't do that and canceled the order making me take one of the colors we already had and at least temporarily disappointing my 6 year old son who did not get the color he had wanted. very very dissatisfied with best buy customer service on this and this insadent will make me question some of my future purchases with best buy.

bought it for my son as a replacement for his damaged tablet. what a great deal this is. i reccomend it fully.	Wired Headphones
it is amazing that a quality tablet is this reasonable. i got a special price, but, even at 50, it's a deal. the down sides, not enough to rate it low, would be the apps are not play store, though the os is android based. you may not find certain apps you want, but, there are many in the amazon store to choose from. also, the screen savers are ads, but you can pay 15 and amazon will take them off.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
decent performance but sometime do lag a bit, screen resolution is a bit low for someone coming from a galaxy s6 and note 7. but for 33 got on a sale you can't expect top end product. installed google play store without needing root, so i can share my normal adroid app even though this is running fire os	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this tablet works just as well as the big name one at half the price	USB-C Charging Cable

i would recommend this tablet for parens. my kids love this tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable

this tablet was bought for my 3 year old. he loves it and it's great. there is one caveat though. it is loaded with ads. everytime the tablet is turned on or screen locked there are amazon ads. because of this i now have a new 250.00 vacuum that was accidentally ordered. so make sure 1 click buying is disab k ed	Wired Headphones
decent tabletperforms ok you really get what you pay fordo not expect anything special with this tablet. it works. does what its meant to do and nothing more. having a prime subscription is a must but not a requirement to take full advantage of this tablet. its pretty much an amazon portal for all the services they offer. great for my son streaming his shows like sesame street, pbs, etc netflix works fine as well	Bose SoundSport Headphones

originally purchased to practice rooting android devices. started using it and determined that i liked it so much i did not root it.it is by design and understandable and expected that it is tied to amazon everything. books, music, mp3 all are available through amazon underground. not as many and maybe not your favorite apps are available but it is loaded with many offerings. notice by design, the tablet downloads and stores all files to an sd card, if one is inserted. solidly built, it will withstand child's play. the resolution is not super high but is very good for its size. i read using this tablet and the text is very clear. in fact, i use text readability as the test for evaluating a tablets resolution. after start up, you can go through simple process to connect this device with your amazon account. this to allow purchases on the tablet. the parental controls are top notch. you can limit or allow as little or as much websites connections, limit purchases also. you can also load google play on this tablet. with a little searching and downloading of files, you can download and play all google play store apps.battery life is good.speaker is good, single speaker only.blue tooth connection easy. note if you have sync microsoft installed in your vehicle, the tablet will connect but has trouble reconnecting! it is microsoft, what can you expect. you will have to unpair, delete from sync then reconnect to get it to work in your vehicle.i use this as my beater tablet for use outside as i do yard work, play music while in the shower steamy environment, and when running around town. it has 128gb sd card expansionfor the money get more than one. i have 5 total and have given away several more as gifts.

everyone knows ""kindle fire"". when these went on sale i grabbed a few up to use as kiosks for our pta. little did i know that fires run a ""special"" operating system, not a standard android. the 2 apps i needed to run were not available on kindle store. after much research i found a work around but it was very frustrating.

i felt the system mived extremely slow not good for streaming great reader	USB-C Charging Cable
unbelievably good value when i bought one at a discounted sale price, but well worth the usual best buy price of usd50. simplicity itself, particularly if you have used android previously. although restricted to the amazon environment and app store, i still found all the free apps i could ever need, and the tablet appears to be very reliable compared to my aging nexus.

overall it is hard to say this is a good tablet just looking at it in a vacuum. that being said when you take the price into consideration, it is hard to say it's not a good value. the screen isn't very bright so outdoor use is difficult i wanted to use it as a screen for my drone but its not ideal, and it's locked down by the amazon echo system. it does work and it doesnt hiccup or struggle too much and again for the value especialyl when i bought it for 33 its hard to argue. it can also be hacked to install the play store on it which makes it even more of a value.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
its good product with the amount. i feel its little slow but okay.	USB-C Charging Cable
this little tablet is marvelous! i do not have a smart phone and this slips effortlessly in my handbag to be scanned at a store etc. it's quick to respond and i can't say enough about it.	iPhone

the first of these failed after a week or so with lines in the screen. i took it back to bb and they replaced it with another. i was able to automatically reinstall everything i had on the first with no problem. i love this device. i bought it to download and read books from my library, but it does much more. it notifies me when i receive mail and i switch from a book to it and can read it on the device and then easily switch back. i can also do a lot of research that i normally do on my pc. i highly recommend it.

Apple Airpods Headphones
i primarily use this as a media tablet and it does it pretty well. the expandable storage is nice and it has around 67 hours of continuous local video play. downsides to this product are the bad external speaker and limited apps available, but hey it's 50.	Wired Headphones
we bought this for our 8 yr old daughter and it's great for most of what she does, but it is not good for playing a lot of games because it locks up sometimes or it runs a little slower. so if we had to do it again we'd probably buy something with a bigger processor.	USB-C Charging Cable
i have 2 of these one for each one of my kids i love it for kids the instead of buying something so expensive i chose this and the geek squad protection is awesome my son cracked the screen and they where just amazing and replaced it with a brand new one	Lightning Charging Cable

i was looking for an affordable tablet for my kid. this was a great buy.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this for my kids, we use the freeplay for 3 a month. we added a 16gb memory card. it is not an hd screen, but it still looks good. and it's faster than other quad core tablets, probably because it's not running heavy graphics. great for casual use and children.	Lightning Charging Cable

i bought my son a kindle about 6 months ago and it was great. until my husband dropped it and broke the screen. so i bought my son another one last week, but i think it might be defective becuz the battery died not fully charge or it takes a super long time to charge, where this did not happen with my last one	Google Phone

this tablet is great for on the go. a good size for reading, game playing, and web surfing.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought the amazon fire to have easily portable access to my email and the internet while traveling. it is a good basic tablet. some of the text is somewhat hard to read as of is quite small. i don't have a stylus which would make use much easier. overall, it is a good value for my limited need's and use.

i purchased this product for my ten year old daughter. she absolutely loves it! it was easy to use, simple to navigate, and even easier to setup especially all of the parental controls and such. i am able to manage her account online and limit her use and time on the tablet, as well as keep track of any purchases she may wish to make. it is a great starter tablet for a responsible youth.	Lightning Charging Cable
most tablets in this price range have the quality to show for it. that is not the case with this unit.while only 50, it feels more sturdy and acts more responsive and capable than other bargain tablets that fit into the same price range.the amazon app store has a lot of great options and the popular apps you would expect from apple or googles app stores. the only downside is the navigation. even then, it is only a personal problem as i am used to google play.all in all, this is a great tablet at an even greater price!	Google Phone
this is my second kindel the old one gave out after many years of service	Apple Airpods Headphones

i use the email, search, and read books primarily. my fingertips are still clumsy on the keyboard but will improve! i forget how to access some things but ask those who know. the kindle fire can do so many things for the modest price. i just need to keep at it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle fire is a great value doing most of what more expensive tablets do for a great price.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this for my twelve year old grandson to replace his two year old kindle fire. he loved the blue color and said it was like his friends mini pad.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
love the improvements they made on this fire kindle.	Wired Headphones
my husband and i originally bought this for our 1 year old so she could be busy on our longer road trips however when it wasn't being used by her, we would listen to our audio books from audible and it was relaxing and provided good bonding moment . unfortunately, i left it in the trunk of our rental car and when i called the dealership, they said they didn't find it. we only had it for about a month!	Google Phone
this is a cheap tablet. i bought this so that my kids wouldn't ruin another ipad by crushing it. this tablet can stop working out of nowhere shut off and never turn on again. if it doesn't have a case and you drop it kiss this good bye because even a light drop can destroy it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought it as a replacement for a broken tablet. there are several apps i'd like to add to it that are not available, and it won't update the facebook app so i wind up using my phone for many things that i used to do on my tablet. if it wasn't a good e reader, it would be worthless, but i do read on it a lot, so i'm keeping it but i would still like a new tablet which is disappointing.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the 7"" screen is just right for size. comes w plenty of extra goodies from amazon and audible, among others. the only complaint is the display in bright, direct sunlight requires adjustment to full bright, or i'd have given it 5 stars.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great little tablet for the money. used some rewards certificates to pay for most of it. if i was to do it again i would buy the 16gb version. very happy with the handy little tablet!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i bought this as a birthday gift for my 9 year old daughter. great gift and good quality! she hasn't put it down yet!	USB-C Charging Cable
not my favorite tablet. its good for the price, but its function is limited.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought 2 of these because they were on sale for 33.33. i really like them, but the kaspersky internet security that i received free for 6 months will not download onto the tablets. i am going to have to call the geek squad to fix this problem.	Wired Headphones
this tablet is a great value for the price point. great functionality and value.	ThinkPad Laptop

we purchased the tablet for our mom's 63rd birthday and she loves it! she had absolutely no problems when it came to the initial setup. our mom has been reading books, listening to music, ordering items through the mail and watching videos like a pro. we couldn't have gotten her a better gift!

this is an excellent price for the amazon fire 7 tab, i highly recommend to product!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet freezes a lot when using it. it started out working good and then it started freezing when playing games.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this hoping that i could use it for a book reader and other lightweight tasks. the wifi is very slow and the tablet in general is slow and hangs to much	Google Phone
i bought this tablet originally for my kids but i loved it so much i had to purchase one for myself. love it!	Lightning Charging Cable
i got it because i wanted to be able to use it to download books for college classes. it is slow and seems to freeze up a bit when i try to use it. i have a 64g memory card in it and have most of my stuff saved to it. i wouldn't think that would cause it to run slow.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought for my daughter to keep her busy and it works great!	iPhone

ok, so, i wanted an ereader and had thought about just buying an ipad mini. i wish i had. don't get me wrong, this tablet does the job it's meant to do but that's about it. if you're looking for a tablet that you can play games on, browse through facebook or instagram on, or even surf the net then you're better off getting an upgraded version of this tablet or an ipad as i said before. plus, this tablet comes packed with apps that are unnecessary and just plain memory wasteful. however, if you just need it to read your books or magazines then this is the perfect little companion for you. i'm saving for an ipad.

it does just what i need it to do! easy to take on the go!	Apple Airpods Headphones
but mind the quality control. for 40 50, you get an amazingly capable tablet for media consumption. streaming services, surfing, and reading are all handled perfectly fine, however, the tablet lacks the power to be a gaming platform.please note, this is actually my 3rd tablet, as the first 2 were returned with the first being covered in dead pixels and the second having terrible light bleed. the 3rd looked and functioned perfectly. bad batch? who knows. but watch the quality control.

i purchased this tablet for my grandma and she was able to learn to use it right away. this is a great tablet for someone who is a beginner when it comes to technology.	USB-C Charging Cable

got this for my 7 year old because of the parental controls i heard about. so far it's been a decent tablet and has some nice controls, but it would be better if the controls could be customized by day and specific apps instead of all apps and by weekdayweekend.	USB-C Charging Cable
simple tablets and i get along great! i don't want to spend the big buck to get someting that a much cheaper alternative will handle just as well. gave my much older tablet to a child, who was overjoyed, and updated version for me.	Lightning Charging Cable

bought this for my daughter 7 yrs, and ended up getting a second one for my son. i do wish best buy sold the kidproof cases, but meh.the tablet is quick, the memory is expandable as well, which is what keeps me from anything iwhatever. throw a 64gb card in this and your kid can make videos on musical.ly all dang day and become a youtube sensation still waiting on that check.parental note if you go this route, take advantage of amazon's freetime. it's fantastic, customizable, safe and easy to stay handsoff. i use it with both tablets with both kids. time limits, no questionable content depending on what you call questionable i hate kidzbop and excellent apps, etc included.tablet is more than powerful enough for adulting, too, so if you despise kids, you can still enjoy your lonely, hollow, selfish existence with this outstanding tablet.

i bought on sale for 35. my sister recommended kindle tablets because of the text to speech feature. some kindle ebooks have a text to speech feature. you can start reading at home then turn on text to speech fir when you are in the car stuck in traffic. we have a prime membership and you can save amazon videos to watch offline. i haven't tried this yet but sounds great for plane or bus travel. you camn download the overdrive app directly for free books, audio books,and video. i plan to download the nook app so i can read overdrive magazines and my nook books. micro sd slot for additional storage. only mono sound which is fine for what i want to use it for. cheap enough that i'll let the grandkids use it.

look was good and very comfortable for reading. if allowed to install android store that would be really awesome.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we bought this tablet right before a trip outoftown, and it was a good purchase. eightyearolds crave entertainment, and the amazon fire gives plenty of that.it's been easy to handle, and hasn't had any issues breaking down.the charger cable is a pain to plug into the tablet only the part that fits into the tablet itself, and some of the tablet versions of apps like neko atsume aren't good compared to the phone versions, but we are overall very happy with our purchase.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought it for my son for christmas and he uses it all the time. great product for the price.	Lightning Charging Cable

great tablet for my 10 year old daughter she loves it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love the size of this, it's the size of a book! the only thing i don't like is the lock screen has ads.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought the fire for myself and it is user friendly. we put some games on it about 1 yr later for my daughter and she actually can navigate it pretty good. so we bought her her own fire which she is proud to be able to listen to music and play simple games.	USB-C Charging Cable
my grandson is really enjoying this product and it is standing up well to his use	Wired Headphones
works great as an ereader. can hold so many books!	Lightning Charging Cable

this is a very good tablet to have for reading or playing games.	Wired Headphones
great tablet for kids! both of my children love it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought for very young grandkids. you get what you pay for. a little slow. good for watching things like netflix and playing games and jwbroadcasting. navigation okay. not great. kids are usually hard on anything, so if it gets broken, ok. but no problems so far and the kids like it. would never buy for myself, or anyone over 10.	27in FHD Monitor
wanted a small kindle to read books and keep kids busy with games while on vacation. great price and size. small enough to carry in your purse or even pocket.	Lightning Charging Cable
great tablet for price. highly recommended, quick and easy to use.	Google Phone
it's a great tablet for a beginner or for anyone that has or had a sumsung phone	Wired Headphones
easy to use and set up to get started. set's up for both of my children	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i was looking for a tablet that will function well for basic web browsing and video playback as a gift for my mom. i initially purchased a best buy exclusive tablet that had a slightly larger screen and more memory than this fire tablet, but it wouldn't comnect to wifi at all and took forever to load to home screen when powering on. returned it and got this fire and am so pleased. it does what i want it to do, although we don't use the amazon extras lol. i just wish the screen size was a bit larger. this connects to wifi well. it does have a couple dead pixels that is really only noticeable when it displays what should be an entirely black image, but does not deter from our enjoyment of this product.	USB-C Charging Cable
excellent for small task and gaming for all ages .	20in Monitor
i'm liking this tablet more and more, the more i use it. great battery life. easy to use.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the kindle is great! great product and great price.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i love my kindle fire! except for making telephone calls i can do so much. i specifically purchased my fire because i knew i was going to be in the hospital for awhile. i am now reading my 3rd ebook that i borrowed from my local library.	Flatscreen TV
great bare bones tablet! great for e book reading! also, can't beat the price! no complaints here!	Google Phone
good for the price. low memory but good descent graphics easy to use	USB-C Charging Cable
the kindle was bought for my grandchildren that also have ipads. i don't have to worry so much about them breaking it and being out all the money for an ipad.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a great tablet for my young son, he is able to order books for school. he plays games and he is able to go onto youtube for the fraction of an ipad. it is great!	Lightning Charging Cable
currently this is the fifth version of the kindle fire that i purchased since they came out. purchased this one due to its ability to maximize storage with a sd card unlike the other ones i have. it seemed to not run as smooth as my kindle fire hdx once i started adding apps to it which is not a problem for me since i use other tablets for that. this was mainly purchased to download shows and movies from amazon prime to watch offline.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my computer crashed and i bought this tablet to get me by during repairs. the tablet allowed me to keep up with my emails and events. i used it to surf the internet as well. it will be used for similar purposes when my wife and i go on a three week road trip in the near future. a very compact and versatile unit.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this e reader is very excellent.the screen is a bit small but you can accommodate.	Wired Headphones
i like playing the games on it and doing email and music that i can listen too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good tablet for the price works like it should with good battery life	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the fire is one of the easiest e readerstablets to use. the amazon interface makes it a true treasure.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this for my 7yr old who loves reading but also loves the apps and games available. this has a fast load time and i recommend a sd card to go with it. we needed it after a few days of downloading books and apps.	Wired Headphones
my 8 year old son saved up his allowance money in order to buy this tablet. he did all of the research himself and decided that based on the price and the features that this was the tablet for him. he can connect to our home wi fi to access the internet, you tube and games. we monitor what he is accessing for safety purposes. this is much smaller than an ipad, but is very mobile and easy for kids to use. i bought a case for it to protect it from drops and allows my son to work from multiple angles on the tablet.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
if you're just going to read and play a game or two, maybe surf the internet a bit, this is an ok tablet. but if you are a heavy user, i'd tell you to pass on this tablet because it won't keep up with your surfinggamesemail.	Lightning Charging Cable
easy to use and has some great features. useful for both kids and adults	Lightning Charging Cable
grandkids love it! it's very easy for them to use. they enjoy reading and playing games!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i am not a savvy table user. i actually don't like tablets to start with. i prefer my convertible windows 10 laptop but there is a bible app called youversion that is very useful to me and my iphone screen is too small and my laptop is too big to carry to church so this tablet is perfect for me. coupled with a leather case it is easier to hold and enjoyable to use. i got it on sale from best buy for 33 tax. it is a great deal at this incredible price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is an ok tablet. we bought it thinking it would be good for travels with our little one, but it's not what we expected. our little one is able to exit out of movies and apps. there is no way to lock the app when it is in use with little ones. this would be a good tablet for a teenager or adult who wants a tablet but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the product is good and easy to operate. i guarantee that you won't regret buying it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this product is fast a stylish. good battery life. helps to be a regular amazon client.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use and great for the kids. lightweight and easy to travel with.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it does exactly what it says for the right price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet for kids but a lot of ads , for someone who wants a cheap tablet that more or less can do all stuff this is a good choice	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
so far i like the backlit feature. i felt the price was affordable. the battery life is not as long as my previous kindle but it does a lot more so that is to be expected.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great tablet and very easy to use. also good battery life.	Google Phone
it is good product.i like best buy.excellent service.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
the kindle fire 7"" so far works well after about 6 weeks of daily use. the battery life is a bit disappointing four hours or less. i bought this to replace my kindle ereader because it was for sale at a very good price. but, it functions much better as a basic tablet. i don't like reading for long periods with this screen. sad to see my keyboard ereader die, but these electronics don't last forever.	Lightning Charging Cable
i'm still learning how to use it. i like that it is small enough to put in my purse.	LG Washing Machine
great companion to any laptop, and an excellent reader. amazon prime membership can enhance the overall ease of use.	Lightning Charging Cable
i was a little worried at first because i brought the tablet for my 7 year old but so far i have no complaints	Macbook Pro Laptop
i love reading books on here. playing games are also nice for the kids with the free time kid app. only thing i don't like is the sound is not very loud. if the sound was louder it would get a 5 star rating.	USB-C Charging Cable
wonderful and fast little tablet. it already servesany uses.	Lightning Charging Cable
this kindle fire 5th generation 7inches is a very good product.it works well.and best buy customer service was so helpful.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love it because it is functional and complete for i needed.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
gave to daughter and son. they are enjoying them very much	Bose SoundSport Headphones
heck fifty bucks for a tablet a name brand tablet that feels premium not bad for the money!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i like the size and it's user friendly. i originally bought a tablet that was bigger but it stopped working less than a year and the size was too big and too heavy for my 7 year old. i would definitely recommend it to friends and family.	Wired Headphones
i love dis tablet just wish the screen wasn't crack!	USB-C Charging Cable
product works well and is durable. great for kids.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this item is ideal for kids to play games and a whole lot more.,my hubby even have one and he enjoys his and i love the picture quality.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i gave this fire 7"" tablet five stars because of the price and quality. you won't find another for the price with so many good features. i purchased it primarily for reading books from amazon and my library. the screen is excellent. this tablet can enlarge the size for best reading comfort. the sound is very good and it's best when connecting to a set of speakers. there's an advertisement when first logging on, which is not too annoying, to pay 15 to remove. it's great for beginners and anyone who wants a light, compact tablet to carry around. i also have a 10"" samsung, but this was difficult and heavy to hold while reading. i also purchased a case to protect the fire 7"". it makes holding the tablet easier. i can't say enough good things about this tablet. the screen, sound and speed while browsing the internet are very good these were most important to me. i highly recommend the amazon fire 7"" tablet.	Vareebadd Phone
this tablet is great for beginners like myself, i haven't done much more than check emails and read articles but there is more to learn and do	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
kids love the tablet the picture quality is good	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my kids love using this device it is perfect for playing games and watching shows	Bose SoundSport Headphones
really good and solid tablet, especially for kids. highly recommend that you buy the case that goes with it too.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
its a great worth of the money spent on it. good for reading	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a great tablet for what it costs. i mostly just surf the web on it a bit but i also watch netflix and espn type streaming apps sometimes and it works great for that too.	Wired Headphones
this was a great tablet for a child and even adults.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. i went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. i'm originally an apple guy, but my ipad has seen better days.the tablet is nestled in compact packaging. inside you will find the sync cablecharger, and the tablet itself. it comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. it looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. it is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.the setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. if you are already an amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup.making it even easier to get started. the picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. it's not hd, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc. there is definitely plenty to choose. i have access to amazon videos, store, and everything amazon at the palm of my hands. the only downside to the tablet is that amazon uses its own ""silk browser,"" which i am not a very big fan of. i tried to see if i could download chrome, but that is still not an option. hopefully it will be some time in the future. the browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. another thing that i found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my email account to the tablet. the only thing that i notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. you have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. it may take some folks a some time to get use to amazon's os, but it should not take very long to do so.	Vareebadd Phone
for reading, games, facebook, twitter, minor surfing the internet, this is a great device. it is small, but not so small as to be difficult to read. fairly quick and dependable. for the price, it is hard to beat.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle. i like the fact that i can read books or go onto the internet to look up my news. definitely can not beat the low price for everything it does.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a great tablet for anyone to use. this is a wonderful product to purchase.	ThinkPad Laptop
works fine as advertised. will recommend it to anyone.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this as a gift for my friends daughter, works really well, good tablet for about 40 dollars. i did opt for the 2 year protection, just in case something happens in the 2 years.	USB-C Charging Cable
not a bad tablet if u like reading. if u prefer aosp and customs android oses i suggest the nexus 7	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
love having the amazon fire, are able to download apps, watch videos from amazon prime, and it includes profiles so kids can have access to it as well. highly recommend!	AA Batteries (4-pack)

great product, good size for travel. we bought it for our girl, we use it when we travel, and put it on the back seat, so she can see videos or movies	Wired Headphones
i bought the amazon fire for my daughter for her 8th birthday. it was decently priced. i can set parental settings and a curfew. i have to confirm what she wants to download. she loves it and plays games, listens to music, and reads books on it.	20in Monitor
my children love this. cant beat the price. need one more for myself.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

good tablet for facebook and games. clean quick and she says it ok.ehhh	iPhone
my son love it can't do anything without his amazon fire on his hand.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
my wife had a nook that she loved, but it broke. the least expensive ones are more than i wanted to spend and i came across the fire. excellent price for a android based tablet with the fire os and reader. with a simple 'hack' you can install the nook app so you can keep any previous nook books as well as using the amazon book store. she loves it! being prime members, she also uses it for video.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it's a little different than most android devices but compatible with them. it was a very small tiny learning curve but if you are like me and using amazon services like kindle, music, audible or prime then obviously the amazon kindle fire was made with you in mind. amazon underground is great for kids as it's offering games that are otherwise paid or have in app purchases for the incredible price of absolutely free. it is amazing i don't know how they do that. i have a collection of games that would have cost me hundreds on my ipad. and there is the problem. you are going to have to buy one of these for you kids when they find out. or you can install amazon underground on their own android device.	iPhone
bought this for my husband primarily so he could get the wall street journal. it works great and he loves that it holds a charge, nice size, durable, great resolution, etc. it turned out to be a great gift!	Wired Headphones
this tablet is technically my 3rd tablet. i always look for something cheap, and useful. i also am always looking for tablets that i know i can easily replace without cringing, if my son destroys them. this tablet has been the best so far. i love the limitation i can place for my son's usage, and the fact i can specify on what they can spend time on! battery time is really good, i usually have to charge it every other day, even after heavy usage it does take a while before it needs to be charged. wish there was more apps, and i have had issue with certain apps, but it may just be those developers issues and not the tablet itself.	Apple Airpods Headphones
love it. use it everyday, and enjoy the books i have read on it.	USB-C Charging Cable
my kid loves her new ""phone"" as she calls it. clear picture and it is fast as well. great item for the money!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
we have had kindle for a while in our family so it just seemed natural to stick with it for my grandson's birthday gift.	Wired Headphones
my son loves the kindle we got for him. it's perfect for the little guys to watch netflix on.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
solid unit for reading and the occasional tv show or game.those coming from a full featured tablet may find themselves frustrated at some of the limitations and quirks of amazon's walled garden, but if your are looking for something cheap they does what it says on the box, you can't go wrong.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
my husband is an avid reader and what better way to reward him for his love of readingand playing games lol	Apple Airpods Headphones
great basic features email, web access, etc. highly portable	Macbook Pro Laptop

size makes tablet easy to take with but still large enough to be easy to see.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
very happy with the tablet. nice, portable size with good display.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i purchased three of these tablets to give away at work. so, while i don't have any firsthand experience, i have asked my team how they liked them.it uses the amazon app store of course, which is fine but doesn't even compare to the google play store. even though, there are a lot of options and most big apps netflix, hulu, etc. are all supported.there is also removable storage. it is very nice to be able to add a memory card to expand your memory. this is a feature a lot of tablets stopped offering.all in all, these tablets are in expensive but more reliable and sturdy than other knock off tablets from different brands. amazon made a great bargain tablet.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
cant beat this tablet for 50 bucks great present for anyone	Lightning Charging Cable
my grandson love it, he play with it all the time love it.	LG Dryer
bought this ""cheap"" tablet not expecting much. this thing blows away many of the more expensive android tablets. the amazon system within the android system works great and filters out many of the android bugs that plague most tablets. perfect for kids and the ""i just want it to work"" crowd.

if you love to read this is a must. only thing that i don't like is all the ads that pop up, when the wifi is open	Lightning Charging Cable

bought it for 2nd twin's bd age 14, after he requested one. he has broken a screen to a different pad it slipped out of the car on to the ground, when he opened the door. he said, ""i wouldn't do itbut i am sure that it wouldn't break, if i threw it down on the ground"" just as the packaging said!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i got this kindle after the kids had been at their grandma's around tons of ipads. they were just as happy with these.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i had an i pad and replaced it with a macair. however it is heavy and when i travel, i dont feel like logging it along! so for 49, i thought ""how can i lose""? so i bought it and i love it! the only thing i dislike are the ads that keep popping up for me to buy stuff. i am not sure it can be turned off. other than that no complaints!

i was not expecting much with this product, but man i was surprised how well it worked. i added the charter app and i am able to watch live tv on it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

this tablet is great for the price. able to play games watch videos and use the internet. its great for kids as well	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great little tablet for people who want to learn more of the modern world. simple programs, easy hook up to wifi and an easy touch screen. the only down side is the lack of memory, which is ok since this is my kids first tablet.	Google Phone
kindles are great as long as your not expecting a tablet that's top of the line. so far no problems.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is the best tablet for the money anywhere on the planet!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is just the right size for someone who doesn't want to always use their phone while on the go. must have wifi but that's not a problem. the response to the touch isn't bad at all. it isn't an ipad but it does the job fo rmusic, books, youtube, facebook and other small applications.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

purchased for a travel tablet for my niece. this was great! able to play amazon music, download a few books and movies, and we were off! i was not planning on this being a primary tablet, but it certainly did the trick for our trip and kept her occupied even in traffic for a 4 hour car ride. i am enjoying it for books as well.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the kids program option are great. don't like that i have to register tablet in order to buy anything though.	Apple Airpods Headphones
bought this for our daughter to use, but nothing worked right and was difficult to use. it's a fairly cheap product, and it shows. ended up returning it and buying a samsung the next day.	Flatscreen TV
starting with the issue. this is the cheaper version because it had ads. if you want to remove the ads it will cost you 15. this might be stayed in the fine print but this is not mentioned or brought up by the salesman.	Macbook Pro Laptop
perfect for what my 8 year old uses this for. watching programs and playing learning games.	ThinkPad Laptop

i am enjoying this product very much. great buy!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
surprisingly good and useful for the price. you really can't beat a 50 tablet. but remember, it still is a budget tablet. tip adding antiglare matte screen protector will great improve user experience and your interaction between finger and screen surface. just like other budget tablets, kindle fire 7 lacks that coating finish on screen surface which will cause screen to attract smudges more than tablets with that coating.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a nice tablet useful on the go and i love it	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i think my aunt likes her new toy. it is amazing how technology marches on. this unit is perfect as an introduction to the tablet for people. even if you have other tablets this is a wonderful addition because you can take it with you as if it's a throwaway. it has the slot to expand memory and the headphone jack has plenty of power and quality sound. it supports bluetooth audio also. any gadget freak should add this to their collection.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

great tablet for kids but you have to keep your eye on them to protect them	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
how can you go wrong? 40 for a tablet that you can use as an ereader, to check social media, to play games on? small enough to fit in your purse? surf the web? and it's pretty fast. i highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for an affordable tablet to use for basic things or for children who are rough on their toys. i plan to buy one of these for my mother who has an older ipad that is awfully slow.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i like the tablet, its fast enough for my daughter and would like it more without the ads or constant 'buy buy buy!' taste i get while using it. free underground apps are nice, my preference is plain jane android so i can control it. do like the limit kids account i was able to setup so she doesnt change all the settings.

this amazon fire has some nice features that my old kindle fire hd did not, like a camera and microphone for video chat. i wish that its keypad would do swiping, though. i miss that and am not as happy with the autofill on this model. overall, though, it operates well. the browser could be a little faster.

i got this for my 7 year old daughter. serves its purpose. it's easy to use and for the price you can't get anything better.	LG Dryer
this is a great inexpensive disposable tablet. it does run on amazon's fire os which is based on android and designed for amazon's app store. technically you can side load it with other android apps to get around some of the restrictionslimitations should you desire. if you are a big amazon prime fan often using amazon videomusic, doing amazon shopping, or need an inexpensive yet still very functional tablet then just get it. for the price, you can't beat it. if you are expecting a big major functioning tablet that uses the google play store or is comparable to an apple ipad that is 6x the price, then this is not for you but you won't find that in this price range.

it may not be a speed demon, but this tablet runs very well and the fire os is easy to navigate and use. i'm taking off one star due to some annoying limitations like the fact that the os makes you use its own browser at all times, but overall it's a smart buy if you want to test a tablet out!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
amazon added ads to this less expensive tablet. annoying	AA Batteries (4-pack)

for 35 you can't go wrong, even at the reg price of 50 i would recommend this to anyone. does everything i need it to and more. web surfing, emails and books all at your fingertips. the ability to download games, etc is just an added bonus. prime is not needed but works great if you have it. i am forgoing the purchase of a case, because at 50 i could just buy a new tablet if anything ever happened to this one. thanks amazon!

picked this up for my wife, wanted a spare tablet for watching some random shows and do some book rentalsreading from amazon. 49.99 is a price that can't be beat, wish i would of picked it up on black friday as it was only 34.99.the tablet has a single speaker, its loud enough for sitting in bed or in a room, also has a 3.5mm standard headphone jack to plug in headphones, or use bluetooth.screen resolution is very good for a budget 7"" screen. nothing high def hd but for the screen size it is very good. if you come from a higher end android or ipad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the tablet echelon, its entry level for both amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets.its a 50 tablet that runs almost everything.fire os is very similar to android os, extremely simple and easy to use. you can make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the fire tab to another person without having access to your information. perfect for sharing.battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use email and web surfing with brightness on 1008gb internal memory isn't enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32gb micro sd card to expand the storage.it does come with unlimited amazon cloud storage for photos and music. camera on the fire tab is good for well lit areas, no flash on the camera, but you can snap away photos and auto uploadbackup to your amazon cloud drive. also comes with a trial of amazon prime.would definitely buy again.	27in FHD Monitor

it is very user friendly. recommend for most ages.	Lightning Charging Cable
got the nieces, wife, and myself these for christmas. figures they were cheap enough, so why not.these are functional tablets in every way. we haven't found any problem with them. the display isn't a hi resolution, so i wasn't expecting great. i've had phones and tablet with the same resolution, but never one that looked quite as lack luster as this display. they are ok for the kids to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had. this one probably wont last much longer, but it's cheap. i wish i would have spent a few more bucks and gotten better ones for my wife and i, though.if you want a disposable tablet or color reader for magazines and such, you'll probably be ok with this.if you want a good tablet, think about buying a good tablet.

i bought this during black friday sales the price was very attractive but i didn't find it that attractive as youtube stream was streaming slow it was taking 1015 min to stream a single song.	Macbook Pro Laptop

while everything about the kindle fire 7 is great, it is lacking good sound	Lightning Charging Cable

i've had the old kindle 7, but love this one more. it's a little smaller so it's easier to hold while using it. great for playing on apps, checking stuff online, and reading books. easy to travel which i love	Wired Headphones
if you are a prime member and use kindle for reading, this a great tablet. i wish there were more apps made to work in the fire tablet, like nfl mobile and nfl fantasy.	Wired Headphones
this is a great starters tablet. easy to use and compact.	USB-C Charging Cable

this tablet comes with a camera and takes good pictures. it's light in weight which makes it great for reading. this tablet is fast.	Wired Headphones
this is a great little tablet! me and my brother in law bought one originally for his dad because his laptop was getting a little old and the main thing he does on it is watch youtube videos. it performs fine for what he does it for. it was such a steal my brother in law got one himself because he wanted to play games on it and again, works perfectly! great buy for the price	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great starter tablet or tablet or kids. i bought one for myself and gave two as gifts. my daughter loves hers and uses it for homework, games, videos, and video chatting with my sister. i use mine to play games and web browse, as well as watch videos when i am waiting somewhere. i love the amazon music feature and use it to listen to music both in my car with the bluetooth feature and my bluetooth speaker system. i have amazon prime, so my experience has allowed me to get the most out of my tablet, but i cannot imagine using it without prime. my only gripe is that devices on the same prime account overlap content, which is a bit inconvenient when i am trying to keep my content separate from my daughter's. it is still a great buy and i am satisfied with my purchase.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet for the money. i mostly use it to watch netflix or hulu movies and read books on hoopla. the picture is great and suits my needs. the sound is not the best but its okay.	Macbook Pro Laptop
works great, easy to use and can easily be changed to android.	Wired Headphones
works great, nice picture, pretty fast only downfall is that you can't access the google play store, which i needed due to some specific apps. that's the only reason for 4, not 5 stars. i will still keep it though. great for the price	Lightning Charging Cable
i got this for my mother who isn't very tech savvy as i needed to get her something to get use to touch screens and smart devices. its fairly user friendly and she is doing well with it.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
for the cost, this is a best buy, if you are tech savvy there are multiple things to come from these tablets. android is available just have to know how to get it.	Lightning Charging Cable
good deal. but i hate that because i buy tax exempt, that best buy doesnt give me the reward points anymore. that sucks!	Wired Headphones
i bought this for my mom who is a first time tablet user. it is easy to use and i love that fact that i did not spend a fortune to get her started!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my second kindle. i bought the original kindle when it came out and loved it! i upgraded to this newer version only because i dropped my old one and damaged the charger port. i'm extremely happy with the new version and use it daily.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them. nice prenatal features to limit use and restrict content in the amazon eco system. build quality seems good. glad we choose these over the cheaper brand that was only a few bucks less.	USB-C Charging Cable
works great without having to startup your laptop to look up items on amazon.	Google Phone
the fire is a decent tablet. it mostly uses the amazon store so you are limited as to some of the apps. if you want something not hd to watch youtube or search the net, then it is worth the purchase. for the price it is a well made product.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this tablet for my daughter and ordered a protective case for it. she really enjoys amazon free time and i really like the way amazon software works.	iPhone

great little device for traveling. perfect for reading books playing games on the go. was priced great during the holidays	Wired Headphones
the amazon fire hd is really nice. does everything i need it to	Apple Airpods Headphones
a bit confusing compared to the older style. i am not a big fan of this version. i wish we could take off things that we are not using like we could with the older version. great for the price.it has an awesome parental control though.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
amazon killed the tablet market by introducing this! 50 for a high quality tablet. needless to say, everyone got one for christmas. easy to use and great quality just a wierd packaging	Google Phone

works great. love the kid option. easy to use. power lasts longer than i thought.	Lightning Charging Cable
very handy to buy parents or grandparents with reading the numbers of choices on one tablet instead of carry 10 books if you are out of state trip like plane.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i bought this for my grandma and she absolutely loves it! very easy for her to figure things out and she is not tech savvy by any means! she loves reading books and getting on her facebook so this was perfect for her!	Google Phone
it's much lighter than my first gen version and slightly smaller. recognizes taps much better and has a nicer keyboard. still has a few things i don't like kind of slow, insists on me using the silk browser, i don't like that i can't delete certain preloaded apps that i will never use. there are some apps that aren't available for it, like chromecast. for the price, it's a good little tablet for internet, reading, simple games, checking email and watchespn. battery life still an issue, rarely lasts more than 5 hours with use.	iPhone
the amazon fires are super to use. you can do more than read a book on them.	Apple Airpods Headphones
its better with a bundle of a memory cardthe operating systen doesnt have google play by default	20in Monitor
was a great black friday find i enjoy playing on it . it's easy to use	AA Batteries (4-pack)
expandable memory up to 128gb. amazon kindleprime benefits. small portable options with stylish accessories from a name brand as opposed to some unknown chinese alternative. i choose amazon everyday of every week at this price point.	Wired Headphones
this equipment is an joy to have.i would recommend product to friends.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a very basic tablet, but the price can't be beat. i bought mine on black friday. the amazon fire 7 only supports the amazon app store, so you will not be able to access the typical google play apps normally available on other brand tablets. i normally just use this as a kindle device.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
purchased two for my twin girls and they love. simple, they can download apps and watch videos. only thing the chargers are working not only after a week.	Lightning Charging Cable
i have get to be disappointed by a tablet from amazon. this fire is amazing. for the price, the speed and quality of this can not be beaten. the features are endless and the screen is beautiful. this is so much more than an ereader. if you are in the market for both a ereader and a versatile tablet, you can not go wrong with this.	iPhone
its lightweight, amazingly bright color display and the best thing of all is you are granted access to thousands of books that are free from amazon	Wired Headphones
bought it for my son and for now is working great, hope this one last longer than the others, my son loves it, can play, can watch movies, music, etc.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we started with the nabi the 2nd edition when my son was 4. then came a few other rca tablets that ran out of memory or quit charging in 6 months. but i just can't justify the cost of the ipad for my 8 year old that dropped my work ipad and i had to pay 250. the amazon fire tablet is the perfect fit for his video game playing. since i am a prime member he loves that he can download music, books and videos for free. being a prime member is almost necessary to make this tablet worth anything. you can only buy amazon gift cards no google play or itunes for this. so let the grandparents know. i like that it has multiple users so i can restrict the time and what he is able to viewplay.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great tablet for books. easy setup and easy to read.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
does the job i expected for the price i paid. good stuff.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

crazy price for tablet. was a great christmas gift.	Wired Headphones
santa"" got this for my 7 y.o. it works well on wifi, can link to our movie library via dma app, add educational apps, and can expand memory via sd card. she can't put it down much to our chagrin.	Wired Headphones
i got this tablet with high expectations given it's from amazon. however it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returned.first off, despite of the small screen size, it's heavy. too heavy to be used as a book reader in bed.the deal breaker for me was that there's no way to connect a vpn using the regular android settings. the option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"". surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new amazon tables on sale have such support! apparently amazon doesn't believe that open wifi at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.on top of that, the amazon version of ""google play store"" has a reduced number of apps and the ones i was interested in are not available.and the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage i was still trying to find a way to connect to my vpn, the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.too bad! i really wanted to like it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
for the price this is a solid win. nothing beats this tablet for the price you are paying. a steal of a device.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the battery on this device cannot handle true apps outside of the amazon ecosystem. youtube and twitch would drain the battery in under an hour. but if used as intended it would be great for books and email.	Lightning Charging Cable
i was really surprised with this tablet. i'm glad i made the purchase. i am able to do as much and more with it as a tablet i paid much more for. i also love the size. the mobility makes it much easier to carry around better than my laptop, great buy.	Flatscreen TV
the tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several kindle books. but only the price is the only note worthy thing about it. if you buy it for 50 bucks, you have pay another 15 to remove the ads and since this is from amazon, there is no google play to get more app selection.true, you can try to side load the google apps but the average tablet buyer won't do this. also, the battery life is poor compared to tablets like the ipad mini or other decent android slates. i'd recommend a samsung tablet or an ipad before i would recommend this, unless you have a very specific use for it and did not want to spend a lot of money.	Wired Headphones
this tablet fits my needs and at 50 the price is right.	27in FHD Monitor
christmas present for my kindergartener, she loves it!?	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased several of these tablets. it's great for kids all kinds of parental controls, but i also purchased one for my 80yr old mother. she loves the ability to skype, check email and read her magazines and newspapers each day. she's also discovered on her own several games and apps in the appstore that she suddenly can't live without. i love that when she gets stuck on something if she can't call me she can contact amazon and they log right into her tablet and walk her though the issue for free.cons it's slow. not for advanced users.	USB-C Charging Cable
this was a perfect gift for my son for christmas of 2015	AA Batteries (4-pack)
if you're getting this for a ""value tablet"" it is a great choice.profile ui is lacking. my main reason for the tablet was to give my kids a tool to use abc mouse.they have to be logged into the parent account to even use it, so it defeats the purpose of having a kid profile.	Flatscreen TV
this is the best tablet ever! great price and quality! i definitely recommend everyone to get this tablet if you travel a lot or just for use casually around the house. at 49.99 price point, you can't beat that!	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my 9 year olds birthday. he loves it. not too fancy, but gets the job done for him.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i came in to best buy to get a game for my bf and ended up walking out with this for only 35! i always wanted one and am very happy with my purchase!	Wired Headphones
bought for reading while traveling. the battery last a long time.	USB-C Charging Cable
gets the job done as a tablet i guess, apps are limited but this isn't meant to be a full on tablet, its a reader. it does freeze ad glitch a little but for the price i guess its worth it.	USB-C Charging Cable
for 35, its worth. the user interface is bit difficult to use and touch screen response is not as expected.	ThinkPad Laptop
bought this for my mom as a gift and was really disappointed. this device does not run full android. you cannot get third party apps even though they sell it as tablet. this device is only good if you only use amazon shopping, books, games, otherwise you can't download anything not even a weather app. not worth my money to be so limited returned the device and got the lenovo tab 2 a7 and we are much happier with it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great for browsing, streaming and everyday web usage	USB-C Charging Cable
best recommendation for a tablet that does everything you need it to do. expandable memory is a great upgrade to the fire!	ThinkPad Laptop
i purchased two of these tablets and i absolutely love them! super ""snappy"" with response time with hardly and lag. easy to charge as well as install any apps you may want. streams videos very well and for the price point it's a great buy. highly recommended!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i always buy ipads because i am an apple fanboy, but these tablets i bought several have been great for the price and for what i want them for and that is to entertain kids at my business. these are much more affordable than ipads if your just playing games on them.	Wired Headphones
great product for the price. purchased this for a christmas exchange and was the most popular item.	USB-C Charging Cable
this was a christmas present for my niece. it was perfect. immediately became her favorite and gave her parents devices a break. would definitely recommend.	Google Phone

very easy to use. price is great . very fast . my grandkids use it by them self. videos look very good	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have a 2014 kindle hdx and i brought two of these. one for my daughter and one for my husband. i love the new features. i will be buying one for me in the very near future. great inexpensive price amazon ! thank you for showing that better doesn't have to be extremely pricey. i also love the fact that you added a memory slot. added 64gb to both. thank you. highly recommended!	Google Phone
i bought a bunch of these as gifts. they were a huge hit. the tablet has better functioning than its older versions which also cost 3x more. i would 100 recommend anyone that wants a tablet for recreational daily uses like searching the web, reading, watching videos, playing games, and checking mail.

great tablet and very easy to use. very easy to grab and go	20in Monitor

it is very easy to use. it also comes with 30 free prime which is a plus to be able to use. it is kid friendly.	iPhone
bought this for my mom. she mostly plays games on it, but loves it.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
it's a 50 tablet, you're not going to get all the bells and whistles. we got it for my toddler daughter to load apps, games and movies to take with her in the carout to eat. you may already know that it does not come with standard google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the play store. there are workarounds found on youtube that you can load google apps through a 3rd party, and i easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the moviestv app, so we can't watch any of her purchased movies on this which was the main objective. apps and games load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for. for 35 on black friday i guess it is still worth it. just really wanted her movies on it.the ui is very basic and promotes purchases everywhere. the lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but i guess they have to make their money somewhere. i took all the bloatware amazon apps that you can't delete and put them into a single folder to make it less cluttered with junk that my daughter wouldn't need. also helping to avoid involuntary purchases. the camera is miserable on it, not that i ever use the camera even on my 500 samsung, but just an fyi. haven't used it enough to really comment on functionality or reliability. in the end, it's a 50 tablet, but a decent one at that. but you defintely get what you pay for	Wired Headphones
i was very pleased with this not only is it a great tablet but a great price.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
not only was this on sale for an amazing price, but i love the parent controls on the amazon kindle!	USB-C Charging Cable
this tablet from amazon is decent. the performance of the tablet is de end too.	20in Monitor

great tablet for the price. kids love it. cant beat it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
bought i, was ok but don't use it anymore for the price it is good though	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i wanted something simple and easy to learn how to use. and it was just that.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i know this was a 7"" screen, but it seems much smaller compared to my ipad. it works fairly well, just wish i could change some of the screens around so i didn't have to scroll so much. it would be nice if there was some sort of tutorial available. works well for games.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i like the tablet a lot its fast and easy to use and the price was right	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this tablet for my nephew for christmas. as i had a limited budget i needed something under 50. the amazon fire fit the bill and more. i don't know how amazon can make money at this price point. fantastic value!	20in Monitor

we bought 3 of these both our sons and our granddaughter love then easy to operate so far no glitches sturdy and not so expensive i have to worry about the kids breaking them and not being able to replace	27in FHD Monitor
i bought one of these on black friday on impulse since it was 34.99 and i had a 5 certificate to use. i have a third generation ipad and am quite accustomed to using it and the app store.pros os is android based and not too hard to pick up compared to apple. i did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. it can take up to 128gb microsd card for expanding storage only 8 gb built in. i got a 64 gb class 10 card at costco for 20.cons screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but i can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. not all apps available even if an android version exists. much more useful if you have amazon prime as it ties directly to an amazon.com account, and in fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.for the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. i'm not one to buy kindle books, but the ones i do have are certainly easy to access and read.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we purchased 3 of these tablets for all of our children. they are perfect for them with little worry that they will get destroyed. still functional for everything they do on them.	Macbook Pro Laptop
bought 4 of these on thanksgiving eve. with their price that night, they were an amazing gift for my daughter's christmas gift exchange, a donation to a less fortunate family, and kept one for me. i can only speak for the one i kept, but it's a great little, easy to hold device for reading.

the tablet its self seem a little slow. but for the price and it being got my kids, totally acceptable	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is a great buy at it's price point and is the perfect entry level tablet. the kindle app is flawless and reading on the fire is a pleasure!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

purchased two at christmas for my niece and nephew. they love them. they're safe for kids to use and easy. the only thing i dislike is the lack of control because of the fire software versus android, but it's all good.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the tablet is nice but the internet source takes forever to load so it is just easier to use a standard computer or phone to surf the web or get on facebook, etc.	USB-C Charging Cable
looked around for a while for an inexpensive tablet. most of the ones under 100 were not worth purchasing. i was a little suspect when i saw the 50 fire but having owned an amazon tablet before i decided to try it out. i must say i was impressed. obviously it's a budget tablet so you are not getting a full hd screen or ipad like performance but it's also a 5th of the price. it definitely powerful and responsive enough for web surfing, facebook, casual games and media consumption. if your a prime member it's a great way to stream all of your amazon video shows movies. the build quality is much better then other tablets under 100 and it's a multitouch screen, not one of the plastic capacitive touch screens. great tablet for kids, grandparents, people with light needs, or people just looking for an inexpensive way to stream amazon video.

i had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to allow apps from the google play store to be installed. without that capability this tablet isn't very good. amazon just doesn't have enough apps available. i did a fare amount of research on the internet to find the process for installing the google play store. i also notice that this isn't a ""snappy"" and ""fast"" device but i wouldn't expect it to be for 50. for the right situation this is a great buy.

checking email is a breeze. all the apps you could ever want. i don't need my computer anymore.	USB-C Charging Cable
i wish ir had all the free aps on google play store. i am finding i have to pay for alot of the free ones i am use to.	Apple Airpods Headphones
there's not much to say about the fire. it's a great tablet that offers a lot of the price. highly recommended!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my old kindle stopped charging, after 4 years, so i got the fire to replace it. i really only needed a reader and that is how i use it. the battery runs down much faster than my old kindle. the price was right so i guess it will work fine.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
set up was automatic. i really didn't need to know anything specific. just follow the prompts. really great for my kids.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this for my 6 year old daughter so she can have something to play with and more importantly, to be used for her school as it's being technologically driven. large screen and good graphics. it's great for what she needs. parental controls are great for restricting access to accidental purchases and setting curfews so she can no longer use it at certain times wo my code. i give this 4 stars only because the camera isn't that great. in lowlight settings, it gets very pixelated, plus there's no flash.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i use this for facebook , checking email, and streaming pandora while in a hotel. don't ask a lot from this because at the end of the day it's still a 50 tablet. battery life is really good, however it's really finicky about the power cord while charging. the biggest complaint i have is it wants a credit card even for free apps such as facebook and youtube. however you can work around by getting them on your desktop and having them sent to your device. overall extremely satisfied.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the second amazon tablet i have purchased and they both work very well. my 8 year old does his homework on the tablet. the screen is bright and clear, build quality is good and he is delighted with the number of games available	Macbook Pro Laptop

AA Batteries (4-pack)
it's a basic tab. only for reading. i didn't keep it.	Lightning Charging Cable
we got this tablet for our grandkids for christmas so they would leave their parents phones alone. this way they can play all the games that they want on a device that is not quite as pricey as the smartphones. they love the tablet, but we needed to block the purchases from our grandson who is only 4, as he downloaded a game on christmas that was not free before we could stop him. our fault.

the fire 7 interface is much better the kindle fire 7 which has had problems with email. the interface is similar to a smart phone which offers a learning opportunity for novice smart phone users. i both this fire 7 for rose because of similar interface and her older kindle was presenting problems.the downside is the ads that popup when it awakes from sleep mode, but you can't beat the price. this unit makes a great gift and two of our friends have purchased the fire 7.

i bought this to enjoy the comforts of a tablet. my use includes youtube, twitch and other channels that are similar in purpose. i would recommend this product for its own intended purposes which is a ereader at best. it does have its own android base functions but not the functions i enjoy from a regular tablet. some regular app you might use on a daily may not be compatible with this unit to sum it up.	USB-C Charging Cable
this was a christmas gift for my nephew, he really enjoy playing games a watching videos, its a cheap and good alternative to the ipad	Wired Headphones
great little traveling entertainer. good for reading and playing most games. you'll be disappointed by the limited content and the internet functionality is very limited. other than that, for watching short clips, or any amazon content, it's great. very pricey. i do not recommend this for kids.

i purchased this tablet for my daughter and within 5 days after purchasing it, the screen went completely blank. it wasn't dropped and didn't get wet. it is also very limited to apps you can download on it. many apps wouldn't work after being installed. i would not recommend buying this tablet.	iPhone

bought 2 for grandkids 8 11 yrs old christmas present. easy to use, great entertainment, games, access to all their sites. they love it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the price may be attractive, but not worth to buy. after seeing tabs like ipad, nexus and others, you wouldn't be willing to use it as the display is just 1024 x 600 pixels, touch is not very smooth, not so good customized appsgames though there is a way to install all android apps. the build quality is good though.	USB-C Charging Cable
i got the kindle fire for my son for christmas and is is very happy with it. no problems. picture is great. it was a great price!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this tablet for my daughter for christmas. so far, so good. she is able to navigate it easily and there are lots of free games. the battery lasts a decent amount of time. we just charge it at night when we go to bed. the only downfall is you can't watch youtube on it. i'm not really sure why. i tried researching it and there's all these steps you can take to make it work but i'm afraid i'll mess something up so i haven't tried it. all in all, for 50 it's a great little tablet.	ThinkPad Laptop

purchased this for my child who's in his terrible 2s! as you can imagine he has thrown the tablet around but with the protective case the tablet has survived. overall he's really enjoying it. it's a little slow and he can get impatient but it works a lot better than most tablets. it doesn't have the greatest camera but it's good enough for a toddler. overall it's a very decent tablet for a child!

love the products i bought for xmas presents they liked them alot	Wired Headphones
i purchased 2 of these tablets for my kids for christmas. they seem to like it and the quality is really good for a less expensive tablet. amazon also offers games for free that usually cost money, so they are able to get more games as i am not one to buy games on devices. it only has 8g memory but i purchased a micro sd card for both for more storage. it's fairly easy for the kids to navigate. overall it's a great tablet for the price.	Google Phone
its ok tablet but you dont have access to all the same apps that are in google play store. also to really enjoy the tablet you should be memebr of amazon prime which i am not.	USB-C Charging Cable
i've already read 4 books on this, and while it took a bit to get used to compared to a physical book, the convenience factor makes this a great purchase!	AA Batteries (4-pack)

has tons of free games for the kids not so good for the average tablet user as its not that powerful but i guess that's only my opinion	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i went back and forth about what kind of tablet to purchase for my child. i am very impressed with the ability for things to be simple for her to navigate as well as being able to place perimeters on how long she can use the apps, internet, and watch videos as well as how much reading time she has to have.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great gift idea got it for my father for a christmas gift	27in FHD Monitor
it is an ok product. but the main reason for the purchase was because it was for a first time tablet owner. it is very cheap in price but without a google play store it kind of sucks. but like it says it is ok for the price.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is an awesome tablet, not to mention and excellent price!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the battery life is pretty good and the best feature in my opinion is the expandable memory slot. it allows me to store all of music so i don't have to use my phone and get a call in the middle of a party	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i got this for 35 dollars as part of thanksgiving promotion. its normal price is 50. its a good starting level tab for basic purpose. its not as smooth as ipad or galaxy note but its ok for basic browsing. i specifically got this for my 3 year old to watch youtube and play some light games and it works perfect. i am not much used to android so i found it a bit tricky to use. it also has a slot for microsd card so that solves your memory issues.

i purchased this for my wife to read books on she enjoys it	Bose SoundSport Headphones
a good computer device to use when traveling at a fair price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is great for ereading and basic internet use.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this thing is a disaster. unless you are a child or have never used a tablet in your life, you are in for disappointment. they've blocked the google store, so good luck downloading most of the games you like. youtube? owned by google, so again, can't download the app. you can get there with the web browser, but why should you have to? i tried to download 3 games none of which would even load. in short, i owned it less than 16 hours. waste of my time. save your money and buy a samsung galaxy tablet.	Google Phone
ok overall but brakes easily with obly one fall to the floor	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this tablet because it was a cheap alternative to use it on roadtrips and watch movies. it also is perfect for the kids to play with it without worrying to much if they break it.	Lightning Charging Cable

my kids used the fire on a resent trip abroad . it works great for sending emails using the wifi and playing games.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this around the holidays and i'm happy with the quality of the image and videos. you may be just fine with not having as amazon prime membership and just use it for light web browsing. the screen gets easily smudged but for the price, it's a great value.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this as a starter tablet for my 8 year old daughter. we first bought one just for kids, but the parental controls didn't work right. so i just set up a password on the kindle for anytime it's in use. with moderate supervision, it worked out great. she uses it mainly for reading, watching netflix, and playing games.

i bought three of these tablets for my three boys ages 9 13. the tablets were easy to setup and the boys love them. they seem to be very durable.i like the fact that i can connect them to my amazon account and they have a lot of detailed parental controls available. i can, for example, limit time on games and movies separately from books so they spend their screen time actually getting some reading done. i can also limit total daily screen time so there is no struggle when it's time for them to get off the tablets.i'm very pleased with the purchase and highly recommend the amazon fire tablet.

the amazon fire tablet is a pretty solid tablet reader for a very low price. reading ebooks is very comfortable and there are some really great apps available through amazon's app store. the one drawback is the web browser it's a bit sluggish. this tablet is great if you are looking for an ereader, and the price is outstanding, but if you are looking for an actual tablet computer you should look elsewhere. don't buy this expecting it to perform as well as an ipad it just isn't that kind of device. overall, though, i really like this.

i like the tablet but the ads can be a little offensive from time to time. i wish you could block ads for magazines and game with immodestly dressed people especially on the lock screen. the device is very nice for what i paid for it once you get passed the lock screen.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i bought this tablet and used it for two days and felt like returning it. it didn't have play store, amazon' s version of android literally kills the processor and makes it too slow. web browsing through silk browser was a pain. it took for ever to load even simple pages like google. apps were all useless, and the only thing you could do is listen to preloaded music not streaming music and read ebooks. anyway, i changed my mind in the last minute and decided to root it. installed slimlp and got rid of amazon's junk, and it made a huge difference. the performance is way better and it actually works like a decent tablet now. it's a great tablet for the price only if its rooted. if you have no idea of rooting or don't like to risk it, its not worth a penny! its a good buy if you plan on rooting it.

after reading the reviews i was very skeptical. i mainly use apple products, but with 5 kids and apple out of my price range this was perfect. i was able to get 4 tablets for the price of 1 apple ipad. the kids love and they don't mind the commercial. i like that i can manage their fire tablet via my phone and i get emails for everything they download. this was perfect for them. and i would buy it again.

i got this for 35 during black friday. since i've had it, i noticed that the battery life does not last very long. i have to charge it at least once a day. at first, i thought that i may have a faulty tablet, but i looked on amazon's website and the fire has a battery life of 7 hours.no wonder.the size of the fire, though is small enough that i can take it with me when i go out and am waiting to pass the time. i also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while i'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.i use the fire for different things. mainly, to play apps and stream videos on amazon prime. for these functions, there's a little in the animation, when i play games, but it isn't frequent.i have read several books on the fire and i must say, that i prefer to read off of the nook hd. the print on the fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the nook.since the fire is from amazon, it is locked down to only work with ""amazon approved"" apps. as i mentioned earlier, i have a nook as well. on that, i am able to download the kindle app and read books that i have purchased through amazon on the nook. on the fire, however, i am not able to download the nook app so that i can read books that i have purchased through for the nook.overall, for the price that i paid, this is not bad. this is one of those tablets that if it gets dropped, i wouldn't get a headache over it.	iPhone
works great, has a great display, easy to use. rivals other more expensive brands.	Lightning Charging Cable
it is basically what you want in a tablet. it has everything, just buying the ads to go away was a bummer.	Wired Headphones

i ordered two of these tablets, one for 4 yr old, and another for mom. it is not user friendly, difficult to use and full of advertisements even when not online. comes with games that kids enjoy, but very limited on other application options. book ordering requires monthly subscriptions. we have purchased another product for mom, and the 4 yr old quickly got bored with the limited options, and i got frustrated trying to navigate.

compared to an equally inexpensive rca tablet, this one has more limitations in the apps you can get. i was disappointed in its utility and prefer the rca tablet over this one.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

we've tried a few different brands of tablets, between the digiland tablet my neice has or the polaroid tablets we bought last year. don't buy polaroid. the brand used to be about quality, but their tablets are terrible. slow, unable to process much, they needed to be restarted constantly from freezing.but amazon's fire tablet is amazing. my mom was so happy with it. it runs so well and is just overall awesome.

after purchasing for myself and mother in the past, i felt it was reliable and friendly enough for my 11 year old. easy to set up and has parental controls. she loves to use it for reading and games. it's fabulous and the price was excellent and my main deciding factor. you just can't beat 49.99. thanks best buy.	27in FHD Monitor
our household is an apple household 3 ipads, 4 iphones, mac, apple tv etc but for the price of these tablets i gave this a try. i had low expectations due to the price point and didn't expect much as far as screen resolution etc.set up was easy, linked with my amazon prime account easily as well.screen resolution doesn't compare to ipad retina display but that's expected.battery life is ok but not on par with ipad.i use it for ebooks as its smaller than my ipads and for checking facebook etc if it's nearby.it can't replace ipad but.i bought 4 of them so everyone in my house has this small, functional tablet.might even permanently mount as small tv screens in bathroom etc.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

great tablet for kids, however do not charge this tablet in your car! the charger in your car will ruin your tablet! the fire 7 tablet charger can only handle so much current and your car charger has too much current! we could not power on the tablet after trying to charge our tablets using the car charger. it happened to both of our tablets and we had the tablets less than 1 month. best buy was nice enough to replace one tablet and give us a refund for the other i paid more money for a nicer tablet.

i use my kindle fire mostly for reading kindle books and i am pleased with this inexpensive little tablet.	iPhone
we 2 amazon fire's for our kids for christmas. we chose these because product reviews were good and the price was decent compared to other electronic pads. since having them, they have been decent, but not great. the kids will turn them on to play games and their home screens don't always appear sometimes when they want to play a game that is already downloaded, the pad acts like it needs to redownload the game and there is a lot of frustration when all of the downloads start circling and they cannot do anything with their pads. turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. when they do work properly though, the kids love them. they are decent for a 1st time pad for kids for not a lot of money, but just keep in mind they can be frustrating at times.	Lightning Charging Cable
perfect tablet for the budgetminded. obviously not as powerful or flashy as many other models, but at this price point, you can't go wrong.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this was a present for my fifteen year old grandson,it was new as described, fast shipping, and he is happy with it.	Lightning Charging Cable

it's hard to beat the quality for the price it cost. great for the kids.	Wired Headphones
it all depends on what your using a 50 dollar tablet to do is it for extreme gaming then i highly do not recommend this device. it is better for light use on the safe side use for 5h a day. 8h a day battery is the average, but runs down faster and over heats when playing a 3d game. but if u are on tight budget it is useful. another major problem is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them, for example clash of clans, racing rivals which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores. and other bigger titles omg even snapchat is not on there.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love this tablet! very easy to use and navigate.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
great alternative to ipad mini and the out of pocket cost is much less.	Macbook Pro Laptop

great value for a tablet. was a gift for dad in his fifties and it is simple enough for him to use and play word games and watch netflix and stuff. got it on sale for 39 which was a steal. i should have gotten another one for that price . best buy always has great prices and selections especially when they go on sale. dad loves his amazon tablet.	27in FHD Monitor

ordered 2 of these amazon fire tablets for my children ages 3 8 to use primarily for viewing netflix, playing games, listening to music on. very happy with these tablets, i also ordered the 'amazon freetime kidproof case' for the tablets and they have made it through 3 months of use and abuse thus far. highly recommend this tablet if you are looking for one for your child. parental controls are very easy to use and provide a large number of options as far as limiting applications, time limits for use and curfew options. my children are very rough on these tablets and with the cases on them they have not caused any damage to them at all. easy to setup and install apps, decent battery life, decent battery charge time, great picture quality when watching netflix or other streaming media, wifi works very good, lightweight and easy to hold for extended periods of time, intuitive controls and user interface. would highly recommend this tablet for beginners or children.

i had an old nonbacklit kindle and loved it. when this one went on sale i bought one for my son an avid reader like me and he liked it so much i bought one for my wife next time it went on sale. i was going to get one for myself but the sale ended. i forgot about it, just kept using my old kindle. then lo and behold it went on sale again so i ran out and finally got one for myself. keep in mind my primary use of it is as an ereader and for that i can't imagine a better device. i can also pop online and check my email etc but i only do that when i'm on a secure wifi e.g. at home or a friends i don't use hotel etc even if there is a 'password' because shared wifi's are insecure. so for 40 it can't be beat.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i ended up returning this tablet. for the price, 40, the tablet performed very well. however, if you have the money, do yourself a favor and step out of the amazon lineup. the ipads are great, in my opinion the best, but they cost . from what i've experienced, the samsung tab a line is a solid tablet for a budget. you can often find one on sale for 150 and its a pretty good bangforthe buck.if the money is your only concern, then this will probably work well enough for you.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased the fire for my self to play games and surf the web. then my husband took my fire so i purchased one for him.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this as a gift for my father to use to replace his now dated sony ereader, and he loves it. he loves the fact it has a back light and can be read in the dark, and even said he reads way faster on it than before. he no longer falls asleep while reading. as an added bonus he's able to check the espn app and more. what a great affordable buy!

my previous tablet was a samsung, it was great but it was exactly like my phone. if you love to read, the kindle fire is the perfect device. so far i have had no problems downloading and the battery lasts longer than expected, especially of you read as much as me. also the picture quality is better than most tablets i've owned.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
got this for my dad so he can easily check email and have an electronic photo album of the family. does exactly what we needed it to do. moved a lot of the standard desktop icons into one folder to reduce clutter. overall, a good purchase.	Wired Headphones
great tablet for the price. good size and great value.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the 3rd kindle fire i've purchased, the first hd in this size. i like the specs, the speed at which apps and books download from amazon, and the accessibility of free time for my younger sons. definitely a worthwhile purchase and i am also an apple user.	USB-C Charging Cable

a wonderful product for those who are not on the apple hype train. easy to use and the price was on point. expandable memory really makes this a million times better than the baser ipads	Lightning Charging Cable

i purchased this tablet for my ten year old twins. it's a great gift for this age they haven't put it down. no issues yet and easy to navigate through the apps.	Wired Headphones
love it! my amazon prime membership keeps on giving. amazon shopping first, amazon tv next. now now fire tablet. wow. free movies and books download. and this tablet can handle it. at lower price point than hd. i was worried about its screen. but, you know what? it still looks good. i guess when i look at it side by side with my other galaxy tab, i can see the difference. but, when i just watch this, it looks great. i have been watching hd tv for awhile now. so, if it is bad, i will know. this one is still pretty good.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my wife and i actually bought two of these for our two younger children. i love that they give us control over how much screen time they get, when they're available to be turned on, and when they turn off. as well as when they can play the games after their reading time. just awesome.	Google Phone
always wanted something transportable bedsides my phone. this fits in my purse and is readily accessible for travel. great product for internet accessibility.	Product
pretty tangerine color. first tablet had bad earphone jack second product would not connect to wifi no matter where we tried. all of our other tablets work fine.we will order another amazon fire tablet.	Wired Headphones
first android tablet i have owned and i liked enough to taste the android marketplace and os. runs smooth and snappy display. all the amazon apps, plus you can download the google play store and have a choice between the two. overall, definitely worth the money and neat media player if nothing else. and can't beat it for the money spent	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought the kindle fire after i upgraded my primary tablet to a 10 inch. the 10 inch was too big to take to a coffee shop to read or to use outside. this is perfect size. i put a 2gb as card in it to hold my books. i can down load a couple of books and take it on the road.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my 4th fire tablet. they're so affordable, i buy them and end up giving them away to family members.	Wired Headphones
waited quite a while before buying this kindle reaader. weighed it heavily against an ipad. talked to friends about their experiences with reeaders. the kindle just seemed l8ike it would do the job i wanted much betterand the price was fantastic. i have beeen pleasantly surprised with what a kindle can accomplish and how easy it is to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
i am still learning how to using it. i use it for facebook, emails,play games on facebook, eventually i want to be able to use the camera which i haven' t figured out yet. once do i will be doing a lot of picture taking!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
if you want a good tablet and don't want to spend a lot of money, i recommend this. well made and reliable. i have one for myself and bought one as a gift.	Macbook Pro Laptop
the kindle is just great for my mom, who would mostly just read on it and download the bible.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this tablet is so awesome and my niece's and nephew love theirs	Bose SoundSport Headphones
lightning fast no but still a great and inexpensive way to get the latest book release and maybe to check the news. price was unbeatable	Wired Headphones
perfect size for onthego people. easy to hold. easy on the eyes. battery life is excellent.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the movie i got was a good one, and i always buy my movies at best buy. they are the best places to go buy movies. and other electronics.	USB-C Charging Cable

the product works great as of now. it arrived as promised	27in FHD Monitor
bought for my son liked the price. he likes it but had some trouble with screen brightness and resetting it.	Flatscreen TV
this tablet is good for the price. just be aware there is adware that cannot be removed unless you pay amazon 15. there are other tablets available at a similar price without the adware if you are not interested in amazon products or services. if you are looking for an android tablet will be disappointed. this tablet has an android operating system but it is not available due to the amazon operating system overriding it. the screen resolution is average. if you are an amazon user this is a good tablet, otherwise look elsewhere.	27in FHD Monitor
i loved the movies and the tabletperfect for my purposes. jbl wireless were greatfor music but werelacking for phone use.	Macbook Pro Laptop

this is awesome. this item was a gift for my elderly father in law who isn't too tech savvy. didn't want to spend the big bucks with an ipad so this was a great alternative!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the fire is best used as a book reader, but having the ability to check mail, surf a bit, etc., is very nice. for the price, it can't be beat.	Apple Airpods Headphones

nice inexpensive tablet for my kid. i put some movies on it and she was very happy on a 4 hour trip.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love love my fire, you get way more than you expect from this fire tablet, plug into speakers great sound, reading screens are wonderful with the ability to use night time light, takes amazing photo's and videos, with good quality sound, sms access is so easy and you can even receive calls, all search engines are accessble. i am getting my little grandkids each one of these with the great tablet protecter. this tablet is kid friendly and as a parent you can control everything they see. price is amazing and you get way more than you would expect from a tablet that is so affordable.	Wired Headphones
it works wonders it gets the job done for a cheap one it's really not bad at all for the price	Product
great device and a great price! many apps available too!	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this kindle fire tablet as a gift for one of my grandkids. it has all the features they wanted on a tablet, plus it's so easy to use!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i like it. bought it as a birthday gift for a three year old and they love it	Apple Airpods Headphones
does what it's supposed to. fine for reading or watching video. but i was anticipating it having a swype keyboard my earlier gen kindle has one and it doesn't. ended up having to buy a a bluetooth keyboard so i can use it to type notes at work.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it does everything i need it to do, but the battery life is short lived. i bought it with the intentions to keep my toddler entertained. the battery last about 4 hours, if it runs continuously. if it is intermittent use it lasts about 12 hours. worth it for the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this as a christmas gift for a family member, i've heard nothing but good things about it. great little tablet for a great price.	Flatscreen TV
i've had my kindle fire for a couple of weeks and am really enjoying it. i've been impressed with the processor speed and image quality. no problems playing videos or music. the ereader app is great and has a lot of easytouse features. we paired this with amazon prime in order to utilize its functions more fully.	USB-C Charging Cable
i had an older version of the kindle and was starting to have issues with it so decided to look into a new one. the week i decided it was time to look at purchasing a new one it was on sale! that was an added bonus. this is a great improvement over the one i had and it cost considerably less. it's much faster and has a camera.	Wired Headphones
i did not use this product i gave it as a present.	Lightning Charging Cable
great for kids use, not a lot of internal storage so a memory card is useful	Bose SoundSport Headphones
totally satisfied with performance of tablet. i would recommend to friends and family.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this for my 2 yr old. for his first experience with plane rides and airport waiting it was very helpful in keeping him quiet and occupied. it can be a bit slow depending on your wifi connection but not problem enough for me to dislike it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my 7 yr. old, for reading, games, and netflix. the only minor annoyance are the ads. its a little difficult for young new users at first, but she will figure it out! overall a great purchase!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
another great amazon product. simple tablet that does what i need it to.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i purchased this for a 5 year old so they'd leave my ipad alone. so happy i did. easy to use and live that you cad increase memory to	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
tablet was for my 9yr old. it works great. it has good parental controls. it could use a little more memory but well worth the money paid. ship to store worked perfectly.	USB-C Charging Cable
great tablet. we wanted orange which took a little while to get shipped but came in couple weeks.	20in Monitor
loved it, it is exactly what i needed for my granddaughter she can play unlimited games	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great if sharing between kids. you can set up a timeframe for each of how long they should be on it	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it has a timer for kids when you set the time you want it on and the off	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a great tablet. it's user friendly and has some great features. great buy.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought 3 of these for my mom, mil and 6 year old. all love it. you can not go wrong at all for the price. and it's very sturdy. love it!	20in Monitor
added more memory downloaded movie and shows to the fire and went on vacation it was perfect, also found out you can download amazon prime movies to watch offline, that is awesome for travel	Wired Headphones
i no longer have to worry about my phone dying on trips. this charges my phone about 4 times. great product. i highly recommend it.	27in FHD Monitor
i like this a lot for an entry level tablet. i am able to watch videos and set it up to read books. there is some lag at times but nothing too bad. i had to add a memory card because the 8gb is small. some apps can be downloaded to the memory card but it does optimize itself and will create space on the hard drive. the ads are only on the lock screen, never when using the tablet.	20in Monitor
can't beat this tablet for the price. great for reading and basic games. perfect second tablet for taking places without worrying about all the things that can happen to your more expensive tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought 2 of these for my younger girls for travel. it is great. only downfall was low storage but that was fixed by adding additional memory card.	ThinkPad Laptop
bought the amazon fire tablet as christmas gifts for my grandsons, ages 8 and 12. they both liked it. it has a nice size screen for them to play their games on and you can't beat the price. better than having them play on our expensive cell phones.	iPhone
it's been solid so far. can get a little glitchy every now and then, the text isn't as high a quality as it could look, and it may bother some people that not all apps from apple and google are available on the amazon app store. but for the price i think it's a good deal for those who want it more for small stuff like internet browsing, email, music, videos, etc.	Lightning Charging Cable
tired of by buying ipad's because there's just not enough memory? look no further! basically the same apps in the app store can be found here, but even better expandable memory storage!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great for my 7 year old son. has all his games and favorites apps installed. easy navigation user friendly.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this tablet mainly to use as an ereader. i now find myself checking emails and surfing the web too. downloading an app is a simple process and there are lots to choose from. i use overdrive and borrow books from my public library. i gave it a 4 because it seems a bit slow at times.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the recording quality is very good. i would recommend this product.	USB-C Charging Cable
user friendly even for a nontechie person like my mom.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
tablet does great for its price segment. very resourcelful and fun for kids.	iPhone
bought the amazon fire tablet to read books and brows the internet. works well very happy,	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this tablet for my grand daughter and she loves it. she loves playing her princesses games on it. we even got most of her videis on it so she dont have to have internet to watch them.	Wired Headphones
bought product for my 9yr old, it works fine for her,she is constantly on it and so far no compaints	Apple Airpods Headphones
i think that for the price, this product is fantastic. it is more than acceptable for media consumption. i highly recommend it for those on a budget or need a secondary consumption device.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my dad and he loves it. he does not do anything too extreme just basic apps. and it handles multiple apps well and for only 50 it was a great value deal. excellent for games and light activities.	Lightning Charging Cable
purchased this for my older son to be able to skype with me over long distance. it is a great tablet and functions well for movies, games, and skype.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this to replace a dedicated kids tablet another brand that had wonderful software but not a replaceable battery. barely got a year and a half out of the other brand. the price difference between this and the dedicated kids version was largely a software suite subscription so i bought this. along with her mom we found free and age appropriate software. i loaded up a micro sd card with music and audio stories. both grand daughters love it, as they are 5 and 3 i bought the bumper to help protect it. it's not in the same league as my samsung tablet but for 18 its cost or 16 the cost of the dedicated kid brand it's great.	20in Monitor
i love it! we have them for all our children and they love them	iPhone
this is my 2nd amazon fire and i prefer my previous one only because i don't care for all the advertisements that pop up while i'm trying to do things on this one. otherwise, it has good speed, clear screen, and is easy to navigate.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought one for myself and really liked it.bought this one for wife, so far shes pleased.perfect size for purse and portability.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought tablet for myself 50 something wanted something for travel and easy to store.this was perfect for my needs.bigger than small screen phone and smaller than computer. i've had no trouble with wifi or streaming such as hulu or netflix. as mentioned for the price you cant beat it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great tablet and its price for it, it's awesome my kids love it and it keeps them entertained.	Lightning Charging Cable
personalized to go with my amazon prime account and inexpensive enough to get 1 for each member of the family. easily read books, watch movies and powrful enough to go online for shopping and reviews.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
wanted a tablet that was cheap in price but good in quality. this is it. plays the games they enjoy, e books, you name it. parents controls are great. you can limit the time they have on different fields. has help my kids with time management. they know a few minutes here and there can add up quick, or let them play later.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased this tablet for convenience and was surprised at how easy it is to use and how well it performs. it downloaded all my information from my paper white tablet and i was able to download email and other important apps.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet, although small, can pack a huge punch. it holds charge really well. the graphics are very high quality and there are so many amazon apps for the whole family to use. love it. i use it all the time. definately a great buy if on a budget.	20in Monitor
i use it mainly when i am traveling to read books, watch movies, listen to music, play games and check email. works very well and does everything that i need.	20in Monitor
i can play all my games that i play on facebook and much more.	USB-C Charging Cable
very affordable. excellent tablet and comes in different colors	AA Batteries (4-pack)
so easy to read books from and play my different games that i enjoy. the set up was really easy did take a little while to get it going but probably more my fault than otherwise.	iPhone
didn't like the return policy on this item. i couldn't purchase insurance on it in the store.	iPhone
this kindle fire is very easy to use and has so many apps. love it!	ThinkPad Laptop
i got this so my son would have something to watch movies on while on a long car trip. it does that, barely. the 50 i spent for it was worth it. if you get an sd card for it you can load and watch movies. the wifi sucks and it sometimes doesn't stream movies from netflix. forget about youtube.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this to replace my kindle white and it's very good	USB-C Charging Cable
good tablet for kidsand for adults.does the job .	iPhone
the many features make this an ideal tablet purchase.	Macbook Pro Laptop
affordable price awesome quality i love my amazon fire tablet	27in FHD Monitor
this is a perfect tablet for my 9 year old daughter we weren't looking to spend a whole lot of money since she has broke two already. the only thing i wish you could change is the home screen you can't customize it like most tablets but other than that great speed the camera is ok and the battery life is great.	Google Phone
my kids love the games and browsing the web, perfect for a gift.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i still haven't used the camera, once i figure it out i will use it. i love the features on it. i use it for facebook mostly emails. i also play some of the games on facebook.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

AAA Batteries (4-pack)
awesome device! i used to have an ipad mini and really expected to be disappointed by the fire. i'm not. not at all. it is great and does everything i want it to do.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was given as a gift. the recipient is thoroughly happy. it is something he has wanted for awhile, mostly because his siblings have one too.	Flatscreen TV
don't let the 8gb prevent you from buying this amazon tablet! once you insert a micro sd card, the tablet literally saves everything to the micro sd. be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an ipad or a samsung galaxy tab. for forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with amazon underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free inapp purchases. yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! note that this thing comes with ads. but they only appear on the lockscreen and actually aren't that bad. they are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. other than that, you'll want to have a prime membership so you can take advantage of the prime videos and what not. i recommend getting at least 32gb micro sd i believe it supports up to 128gb to store pictures, videos, music etc. obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.the pictures it takes are ok. good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.screen quality is pretty good. not sharp and crisp like a retina screen, but i was able to read my kindle books just fine. the viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel crosseyed like some cheaper tablets out there.battery life is very good on this tiny tablet. something like 45 hours with normal use. videos and games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game i've thrown at it so far.if you have kids, the freetime app is very cool. you have to pay a small subscription like 2 bucks a month or something with prime but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.well, that's all i can think of. this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality. if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
you cannot download any other internet service you're subject to very limited options to do things on it wish i could not have bought it	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my 10 year old absolutely loves his fire. he can download his favorite games as well as his favorite books to read.	Flatscreen TV
i bought two of these tablets, one for my daughter's graduation and one for me. i like the size, the sound and picturemovie quality of it. it was a great price and the option to choose different colors were nice. i didn't give it 5 stars for the simple fact i can't get all of my important apps that i used on my android tablet, ex. one of my credit unions, favorite news station and a few others. other than that, not too bad for the price and other features i named previously.	USB-C Charging Cable
i would recommend this tablet to anyone that is interested in one. it is just as good as a samsung one and half the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
the quality is awesome for the price. amazon products are always cool.	Lightning Charging Cable
my kids are growing out of their ipod touch and i wanted to get them something bigger. the kindle fire tablet is such a great deal so it was a no brainer to get all three of my kids one.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we actually bought this for my son as a replacement tablet. he likes it but does not like the fact that not every game that is available in the google play store is available on this one. overall it is a great tablet. works quickly and he enjoys it.	Wired Headphones
bought this item for my son and he loves it it works great for movies and games that he likes to play its the perfect size for a toddler ! can't beat the price or how great it works	Lightning Charging Cable
pretty good tablet not great but still solid for the price	20in Monitor
not bad, especially for the price. mine had one dead pixel in a prominent place that was pretty annoying. i ended up returning it and buying a 10.1"" lenovo tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
this was a gift for my girlfriend a she loves it wow	ThinkPad Laptop
i understand you get what you pay for but come on amazon. you make millions a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup. the only thing this tablet is good for is collecting dust. in my opinion, if any company is going to integrate the androidos at least make it user friendly and 100 open. it's basically like purchasing half of a device or a demo device.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought it for my students to use. it is not a great resolution but it's great for reading books.	USB-C Charging Cable
after searching online for the best price, i found this on bestbuy.com. i ordered it and picked it up at our local best buy the same day. great product at a great price.	Vareebadd Phone
this was bought for my daughter and it works great with her but i wouldn't recommend it for anything intense.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is easy to use and fun to download apps with. i spend many hours on my kindle fire 7 reading and playing games and going online.	27in FHD Monitor
great value for the price. not as user friendly as the original kindle fire but still a good starter tablet for those that are less tech savvy.	Apple Airpods Headphones
tablet was ok when it worked. seemed to always have to reset our wifi at home for this one item. everything else worked fine.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this certainly isn't the most impressive device out there, but at 40 it is a fantastic value.	Apple Airpods Headphones
ok, let's face it. kindles are not the fastest nor do they come with a quad core processor. but they are great for simple reading and light web browsing. but for 39.99 on sale it was a steal. thanks best buy!	ThinkPad Laptop
this was a graduation gift to my son, who is going to the 6th grade! he loves it, and so do i! he had a samsung galaxy tab and he loves the speed of the kindle tablet!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i've had amazon tablets in the past and this is the far worst i've bought. it was slow, drained the battery, kicking me out of the apps all the time.	Google Phone
great little tablet.does everything i wanted it to do. it's a breeze to get online and check email.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this as a cheaper alternative for using with kids. battery lasts longer than most tablets, the reason why i gave this such a mediocre rating is because you can't put a wallpaper for the lock screen. you always have an ad for something amazon related, which can be annoying. but if it's just something small for the kiddos to use, good choice. i wouldn't recommend for adults.	USB-C Charging Cable
good for beginners. small for little hands. my 9 year old son loves it. he can read books on it. the video quality is great.	Lightning Charging Cable
i love the tablet . now i have time to catch up with my reading and tv shows and also facebook and magazines	Lightning Charging Cable
this by far is one of the greatest tablets out there for kids. cost is affordable and there is a lot for them to do. keeps my 8 year old busy in drs offices. lightweight and easy to use.	Product
excellent product. can get some apps that the fire stick and roku 3 can not. of course this is a small screen but offers more flexibility than just streaming. its a computer, kindle and mobile device all in one.	iPhone
i bought one for both my kids and they love it. we are very happy with the purchase.	Wired Headphones
the amazon fire is perfect for my son. he loves to play games and the app store is easy to use!	USB-C Charging Cable
great item ! bought one for my 20 yr old as a christmas gift . ended up going back and getting one for my 11 yr old and myself as well. i am not good with electronics this is easy to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
my 11 year old nephew actually had a tablet before i bought the kindle for his graduation. now he only uses the kindle.	27in FHD Monitor
excellent price and recommendable for kids family.	Wired Headphones
i got this tablet for my 20 month old son. he constantly wants my phone or ipad to watch youtube kids videos. he can work both of these apple devices all on his own. i figured he was ready for his own tablet, hoping he'd leave mine alone. no luck. the fire is not as userfriendly as my iphone. even on the child setting it is not easy to use. the surface is not as responsive to touch. he gets frustrated with it and puts it down after a few minutes of trying. now his daddy uses it and he still goes after my ipad and phone. if you want a tablet for your toddler, just get an ipad.	Google Phone
i thought i would get the fire as a back up tab for my grand daughters. well, in my opinion it's a little more confusing to navigate around than just a plain android tablet. so if, like me you are an android lurana566, this is a bit different to operate.	27in FHD Monitor
this was a gift for my daughter and her first tablet. she likes it and is learning how to use it with the help of her son.it is easy to handle and the size is easy to carry with her.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy set up. great features. can't beat the price.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
love this kindle it's a great size for travel as i can read it or check my emails or play games.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i am more interested in kindles for learning apps, and all educational books for adults children all ages.	Macbook Pro Laptop
has a timer for how long your kids can be on the tablet	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a nice, cheap little tablet. it's simple but for the price i don't have too many complaintssome things i've noticed though is that the battery life is very short and appears to drain battery even when not in use. i find it difficult to cut and paste text and i'm not sure how or if you can save pics to the gallery. this tablet is best for streaming media and simple browsing.

really impressed with what this tablet is capable of doing for price. at only 49 dollars it is pretty snappy accessing the internet and playing videos are sharp and clear. most of the apps i need to use are available and free. it seems to run similar to android tablets which should be easy for someone familiar with how android operates. this might be for kids to use but it fits with what i need to use.	USB-C Charging Cable
good price within batter quality love it works perfectly	Apple Airpods Headphones
love the kindle. easy to use and lots of free books to read	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
usually, a 50 tablet is some cheap knockoffno name brand limited capability tablet. for an amazon tablet, you can't beat the price. if you're an amazon shopperuser, this'll be a great tablet for your kid, an elderly adult in your care or you. for 50 or less if you catch it on sale, i'll take the ads	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought to replace older kindle fire. perfect for what i need. use mainly for ebooks, apps, web browsing, and streaming occasional moviesshows.	Vareebadd Phone
i have bought many of these tablets for family members and had no complaints	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought it for my son and he has now been using it extensively for the past 2 months. his primary use is to play games and he gets bored with every game soon. so he has to find and download a new one every few days. i occasionally use it to watch some online videos as well. we'd have loved if it were a bit faster but at the price it's not something we can complain about. overall we are both satisfied with the purchase.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i purchased amazon fire for my son after reading enough reviews about this product. it works ok for ebooks but very slow for internet streaming and downloading. also, the touch function is not very sensitive which you need to hit the same button couples of time to make it work.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
work perfectly for as a small tablet for checking facebook and playting games. the screen is so much larger than the phone for easier viewing. it's nice that it can take pictures, but the quality is not up to most phones.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's ok. it does not have all the apps you might be looking for.	Vareebadd Phone
this is a great tablet. my wife, my 4 year old son, and myself all use this. it is so easy to use, my 4 year old shows me all the tricks. amazon is even easier to use which we really enjoy. i would not recommend the nuprocase however that i think we got from amazon.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for my 8 year old. very cost effective and lots of fun for him.	iPhone
i would recommend this product to anyone on a budget or who wants something bigger than an iphone for searching purposes. it does everything my iphone does. but i wanted a tablet for reading, spotify, netflix, and just the ease of a bigger screen. 40 bucks why not!?	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

my kids had a good time with the kindle and now i feel like best buy is the best store ever.	Google Phone
i have amazon prime and you really get a value out of this tablet if u have the prime. reading books is good with it, browsing web, video play, music, casual games, good battery life. only thing thats not so good are cameras .	USB-C Charging Cable
besides surfing online, making airfare , hotels, and rental cars reservation's, i am using banking online and able to make payments all my bills to a differents kind of business.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
good for watching movies offline but not so good at internet. i also have problems with it deciding i don't have the sd card in and have to take it out and put it back in. very frustrating! the first one i had didn't know the sd card was there after shutting it off. they were great about sending me a new one but now i have to call them back and tell them what is going on now. i prefer to use my old android tablet. it also won't let me remove the password or i have to take off the free time. i have to call them and see what i can do about that. it is for her and not really for me anyway. why do i have to have a password for everything? not too impressed but a really good buy. the ads, when you turn it on, don't bother me at all and was worth saving the 20.	USB-C Charging Cable
like it works for what i need for my son very easy to use and	Apple Airpods Headphones
very simpl to use, compact, versatile and easy to carry	Wired Headphones

reasonable for its price. my grandson enjoys using it and has it going all day.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great device for leisure entertainment. i really enjoy the games and applications that allow me to surf the web.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a very good tablet considering the price. while it is locked down a bit through amazon, it was primarily purchased for a senior citizen. i felt much better buying this rather than other similarly priced tablets.	27in FHD Monitor
works as i expected. pretty fast and pretty good display as well. i can't complain at all at this price. yes, if you take a look at it side by side with galaxy 200, this is not as good. but, as long as you use for surfing and quick things like music and games, works great.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the products were great. i was able to access the books that i had been craving for.	Google Phone
my son loves his kindle! it was relatively inexpensive and he has dropped it multiple times and not a scratch!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the tablet is good for my son, he enjoys using it to play games.	Vareebadd Phone
i love that i can check my text from my watch, rather than pulling my phone out at inappropriate times. it helps me stay organized. there are so many features that are helpful. i reviewed the apple watch and i'm glad i choose this one instead, even though i have an iphone, this watch works for all my needs.	USB-C Charging Cable
very easy to use and it is very convenient. makes great gifts for anyone!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it is a tablet that cost 50. you get what you pay for. it is not more powerful than an ipad but it is in my opinion more durable and is easier to pack when traveling. i only use mine to watch videos on the road. it does have trouble connecting to certain wifi spots but this hasn't been a problem at any airports gets.the touchscreen lags but once the video starts going there hasn't been a problem. it cost less than the price to fix a broken screen on an iphone why pass it up.	USB-C Charging Cable
me and my brother brought this for our mother on mothers day. she can't put this thing down, shout out to amzon for this amazing product.	Vareebadd Phone
if you want any one you don't care about losing get this. it works well with anything you want to do from netflix to reading or browsing the web. perfect for travel. if you lose it or it gets stollen oh well you deactivate it on amazon and your out 50. better then losing a ipad or galaxy tab. you brake it oh well out 50. great for kids with amazing parental controls built right in.

you will get your money worth. great to carry anywhere	AA Batteries (4-pack)
one of the best and most price efficient tablets out there	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my daughter after having previously used a kindle fire hd 7. this kindle was the perfect size for her and she cannot stop reading books off of it.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
pros a beefy machine for the price great battery management in standby. a solidly built android tab at a rock bottom price. cons proprietory amazon user interface may be irritating but this is a personal preference the app selection is limiting. but you can install google play and get all you need from there. brightness and resolution may not be the greatest but completely usable a compromise for the low price had some wifi issues on several occasions compatibility issues?. it is a little weak, also7"" may be a bit small and aspect ratio is a bit weird long an narrowoverall, a reasonable tab that does the job done not many games, though for a minimal investment	Lightning Charging Cable
i originally purchased for 3 year old and it is great especially at this price i love the free amazon apps and the clarity of the tablet i just dont like the app arrangement and slideview app type	Lightning Charging Cable
this was a super deal! i love my kindle and can't believe i got a tablet so inexpensive.	Apple Airpods Headphones
for the price i was skeptical, but this thing can do everything!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it's a decent tablet, but keep the following in mind if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps, you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases. problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases, and you have to okay every thing they do. if you allow them access to apps and video, then that can purchase anything without limits.on top of this, they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive. while you can hack it to add these basic features, you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so.so, it's useful, but a pain too. your needs may vary.	USB-C Charging Cable
this tablet is awesome for the price point! read, play games, consume media, surf the web. and all for around 50 bucks! it's easy to set up and easy to use. nice cameras and expandable memory round out the package.	USB-C Charging Cable

had the hd fire 6 and was disappointed that it did not have an sd slot. this one has the slot and has worked flawlessly. my kids love it. i bought 3 of them.	USB-C Charging Cable
this version of kindle was not very impressive to me. navigating was easier on my older kindle, this model is smaller. also i have had an issue with charging on this device since i purchased it. when it does accept the charge it will charge to 100 rather quickly, however the battery life dies out so much faster as well. at times when i am using i will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ""ding"" noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well keeps falling out. i even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue, it did not.	Wired Headphones
purchased as a reward for perfect attendance for middle school students. this was just what we and they wanted.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i got this so that i could read books on it that i didn't have an actual book version of. i like it because i am able to take it with me on trips and occupy myself that way. also, i am able to have my daughter read books on it too. the battery life is great and i have just purchased another one for my fianc.

i had purchased a tablet for my son as s christmas gift and he loved it, he let me use it and i loved it, especially since i have problems with my hands. this tablet proved to be the best thing for me. my experience with best buy is the best choice i could make on my tablet. the staff is fantastic, they helped me to get the basics down pat, you can add me to your list of return consumers.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this really isn't a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck. i bought this for about 35 just to kill time on a couple of long flights so i didn't wear out the battery on my phone. i definitely wouldn't recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at. i only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so i got what i wanted out of it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

have been reviewing this tablet on amazon for some time. its an extra for us we keep it in the living room.	27in FHD Monitor
my first purpose was to use the tablet for taking photos cuz the boyfriend got a new samsung. this item was in the right price range and i was not aware bestbuy sold the kindle fire and was not aware is does more than download books, too. it is much faster to get online wifi much better than a pc. i have pleasantly surprised at the many uses the fire has. i have found myself playing games on it normally i do not play any on the pc so if i am watching tv, i can sit here with inexpensive entertainment. light weight, easy to carry, quick to use for cameraall kinds of settingswho knew right price. great for sending and receiving email. i suggest getting a 'stylus' for using with keyboard and one may adjust the 'font' size for easy reading enjoy!	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my 5 year old to watch movies on. it does the job but it takes a while just to get google play. they tried to block this feature but you can go youtube on how to add it. other than that i would never buy this for myself but good enough for a kid for movies.	USB-C Charging Cable
this product really helped my father in law hear and have conversations with his daughter who's voice is a higher pitch.	Lightning Charging Cable
this tablet is ok for a kid. i was expecting more because it's a fire brand.	Lightning Charging Cable
tablet is great value. i brought two for my kids and they love it. later i brought one for myself just to have a light entertainment device on the fly. the resolution on the tablet is good but don't expect the resolution of a samsung or apple tablet. i like the amazon interface because you can download certain movies or shows if your a amazon prime member. i don't think amazon prime movies or shows are available on nonamazon tablets so this increases the value. some people don't like the fact that the locked screen has advertising i think it's great. it's a clever way to bring a product to the market that is affordable, reliable, and built well.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this tablet because it had high reviews, and was at a great price for a first tablet.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this tablet works well for me. i use it mainly for checking my email instead of having to log in into my computer all the time. i don't have a smartphone so it is perfect for me.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

purchased this turned around within minutes of the purchase before even leaving the store, found out that it would not do what my granddaughter needed. unfortunately the clerk in electronics had told us it would found out at the register by that person after she rang it up, that it would not. need a little more education, i think.

i bought this in order to read on it while waiting for appointments. i have a larger samsung which i love but it's bulkier and doesn't fit in my pocketbook. this is the perfect size and battery lasts longer.	Lightning Charging Cable
great product, would recommend it if you need a low budget tablet.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my gift to my grandchildren they are on it 247 would recommend this, prices have gone down since i first bought my oldest granddaughter hers	Bose SoundSport Headphones

this is a nice little unit! very portable and easy to read, or watch movies except in bright sunlight, it is easy to change the tablet light to not bother others in low light conditions	Lightning Charging Cable
for the price the tablet works well. the biggest issue i've had is the battery life length. the battery seems to not last as long as my previous ipad mini.	Lightning Charging Cable
purchased this for my mother as a gift. she uses mainly apple products so there was an adjustment to switch over to amazon apps. if you aren't familiar with amazon then this may be an adjustment from google or apple. good for beginners and the price. i liked that there was use for additional storage for a minisd so hopefully i can store movies on there for her.	Macbook Pro Laptop
got this for my mother in law as a christmas gift she loves it	ThinkPad Laptop
this was a gift for my mother and she loves it. great price!	Macbook Pro Laptop
i absolutely love this tablet! i love the price compared to other tablets on the market. plus the display looks great! at first i was a bit skeptical about how it ran, or if it was any good, but i actually read a personal review about the amazon fire and it seemed like the person had a great time using it. the article was very helpful to me if you want to check it out yourself you can read it here	Vareebadd Phone

i got 4 of these tablets, one for each of the kids, and they love them! i love that i can set time limits on it and that i could set it up that they have to read for 30 min before they can play on them. i also like that there are a ton of apps and books that are free.	LG Washing Machine
i have tried to get it work still can't get it to work!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
nice little tablet. works well for watching movies and listening to music. internet use and playing some games can create slow response times.	Google Phone

the parent said she loved the tablet but her son loves it more. he sleeps with it to keep his siblings from touching it. best gift ever!	27in FHD Monitor
these are all true and they really are up on your reading or browse the web with this tablet, which offers access to amazon underground, so you can download apps and games and discover exciting new entertainment. front and rear cameras let you capture memorable moments, love love love.	iPhone
great clarity for a tablet of this price point. amazon provides a great operating system making it easy to maneuver and web surf. the only thing lacking is the camera not making it good for skyping or taking pictures in poor light. however given the dollar per value you can't beat it. attractive looks good fit and finish makes it stand out in a sea of choices!	Apple Airpods Headphones
ok for a kid tablet the size is good you can okly use there apps	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i can't use until i can get the webroot installed.i tried a geek but they wanted 40 to do it.i only paid that much for the tablet. print is so small i can barely read it.there is probably an adjustment to font size but i don't want to get online without the webroot protection.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great product and fits all my needs. would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a tablet for elderly people. they seem to have no problem using it.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is ok for kids but the camera is not bright enough.	20in Monitor
this tablet is well constructed and light weight and is more than i expected. the ereader part of it is the best for reading on a screen because of its blue screen feature.	ThinkPad Laptop
i use his as a second screen to watch videos i've edited in my computer. it's fast enough to play a pretty big video file with no hiccups. however, multitasking is very limited.	20in Monitor
i use my tablet for business and am very satisfied with it. it has excellent resolution and i have not experienced slowness. good product.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this to lay on the coffee table for quick email checks and google searches. if you are looking for something to watch movies on or simple tasks, then it will do ok. not a daily driver for sure.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i really love my kindle fire. it's my second one. it's convenient and has so many functions.	Flatscreen TV

the tablet is great has a lot of great features like access to kindle books and apps.	Flatscreen TV
i haven't paid much attention to the fire since the very first one out years back. but recently i purchased an amazon echo which i am thoroughly enjoying. and i discovered that my echo was capable of 'voice casting.' this basically means that whatever alexa is saying can show up as text or pictures on a screen recipe or weather map, for example and you can then print it out! so i wanted to explore voice casting and the easiest way to do that is with an amazon fire. what a deal! 50 for the most recent version that boasts all manner of things. i even get free movies! so i purchased a case for the fire that would work as an easel stand, set it up as a photo frame displaying a rotating series of my digital photos, and whenever i want to i can voice cast from my amazon echo! playing a music album? i can see the album cover and list of songs on my fire. checking what's playing at which movie theater when? i can voice cast that info so everyone can see it and vote. and we haven't even talked about using the fire as an easy goto for email or games!

good for price, could have bought android tablet but it was no name for the same price. so went with it and my 5 year old really likes it. just be careful of putting your credit card in. my son charged a bunch of games before i caught it. i thought he was just downloading free apps.

very easy to use. great for putting music on to use with wireless speaker	Apple Airpods Headphones
bought it for my mother. relatively user friendly for someone not too familiar with smart phones and such. she seems to like it although she complains about the speed and size of the screen at times. she also likes the size though since it can easily fit in a medium to large purse. the touch screen is responsive and it has the essentials that she needs. it feels and looks nice. the app store is ok for simple use. it's a great price for a simple, beginner, or kids tablet. i would probably purchase something more powerful for my own use.

i love my new kindle! purchased on sale for 39.99 which was a great value. light, compact super easy to use. a big plus for me was that with this version you can add more memory.	Flatscreen TV

perfect little tablet ., inexpensive and perfect size for what i need.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought it for my mother in a nursing home, and didn't want to take a chance of an expensive tablet getting stolen. the childproof settings are perfect for the situation to prevent random purchases. the buttons for sending email are too small for someone whose eyesight and manual dexterity aren't perfect. it's a bit slow on response time, but for the cheap price, a minor inconvenience in this situation.	Lightning Charging Cable
good tablet and reader. it does not have a great battery life, but it is charged quickly.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i loved the kindle. but it took one small fall about 3 feet and half of the lcd screen broke. it's ruined i knew to be careful but on the first fall on wood floor?	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i purchased this for my wife her old kindle fire bite the dust. this unit has better contrast and is easier to use. she loves it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have owned a few tablets and currently own an ipad and iphone. i'm invested in the amazon ecosystem via kindle ereaders and fire tv's. this tablet is incredibly affordable and offers acceptable performance but it's heavily restricted if you do not figure out how to install the google play store as the amazon app store is missing a huge number of ""every day apps"". it's a great extension for fire tv's and it's certainly a good choice as a primary tablet for kids or parents who don't have an apple budget. personally i still find myself reaching for the ipad.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought it for my daughter she reads a lot she had the reader version for years but went blank	AA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased as a gift for techchallenged loved one setup and quick start very simple and straightforward. ease of loading lots of free library books alone made it well worth the purchase. however, if you have reservations regarding outdoor glare, i'd recommend trying it out firsthand before buying.

i bought this for my dad. he had my sister's original kindle fire and it died. so for father's day, i bought him a new one. he loves it. he loves that it is a tablet and a kindle in one great bundle!	34in Ultrawide Monitor

great for the internet. .saves my phone battery	USB-C Charging Cable
i love it. i enjoy playing games and reading on it.	Flatscreen TV
kindle fire is a decent tablet. the only turn off is the way amazon has massacred the android os and makes it incompatible with chromecast most of the time. it's a great tablet for reading and saving media on the go. other than the os, kindle fire is a decent buy.	Lightning Charging Cable
love everything about the tablet! i would recommend this to a friend	iPhone

this is a basic tab. i bought this for my sister. you can't really do anything much on this unless you have an amazon account and you have to buy a prime membership which is expensive. but i was still able to use it for games and internet browsing. i had difficulty using it for anything more. camera was not the best.

exactly what i orederd a great product i have ordered 3 of these from best buy.	Lightning Charging Cable
purchased blue unit parenthesis below is error correction for that review since bb does not allow edit. good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. do not expect the performance of a 400 tablet for 50. i have wifi bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. this is an amazon based os, not a traditional android system. so it is all geared toward amazon advertisingpurchasing and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account, which is linked to and displays any saved credit cardpayment data associated with your account. not very private or secure in my opinion. all apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. there are ways around this of course if you know how. one more thing that is important and it is this. after more than a week, i finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. after searching reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. you may be fine but it pays to look. i did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though i still have the receipt, i already discarded the packaging. i am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all i use it for i am not overly concerned. still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. again, so far i find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need.

the kindle fire is great. i bought one for my husband when the old kindle quite working, then i bought one for my daughter to replace the ipod she lost. she loves it. i love that you can add extra storage with a mini sd card something you cannot do on apple devices.	Lightning Charging Cable
i wanted a replacement comparable to my original, and this filled the bill.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
snagged it on sale for 39.95. then got another discount from accumulated bb points. it's not hd, but i don't find that necessary on a small screen. i like the form factor, fits into coat or jacket pocket. amazon app store lacks the number of apps of google store but there are easy ways to install google apps store. while you can use it for productivity tasks with a compatible keyboard i bought it for my wife to watch youtube and netflix shows on a bigger screen than her iphone. its wireless signal pickup distance is a bit weak, but the ability to add storage via micro sd is nice. even at 50 it is a good buy for what it is.

this tablet is awesome and so powerful and easy to use	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
decent and simple tablet that gets the job done.excellent!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the number one aspect of this tablet is the fact that amazon will stand behind it for a short while. i am on my 3rd, all of which have been plagued with screen issues. dead pixels. everywhere. if you don't have them straight out of the box, great.but, they can develop and in the great majority of these, they will develop. it is a known issue, and amazon will at least for now replace the tablet at no charge to you. as of now, they have a 'zero dead pixel tolerance policy.' that will likely change if it hasn't already. as far as operational ability of the tablet, it runs smoothly, and allows for up to a 32gb micro sd card which i highly recommend, as they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware if you buy an 8 gig, you'll have about 3.5 available to you. it is a decent tablet for browsing the internet, using as an ereader however, the screen isn't as bright as other ereaders, or mp3 player. as they say, you get what you pay for. this is a decent basic option.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i had a firstgeneration one and still in good shape. i purchased this new one mainly because of its updated os 5. it seems also lighter. the performance is quite satisfactory. the sd feature is an important upgraded feature to the previous model. the only drawback is its oversimplified wrapping, even simpler than most lowend smart phones.	Macbook Pro Laptop
it does a lot of things as well as a more expensive tablet so it's strong for the money spent	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet for a gift. does everything it needs to do.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my mother during mother's day and i got a 10 off.overall i paid around 42 for the tablet. best tablet money can buy. it includes youtube,pandora and all the other good apps you get on a normal cell phone. i bought other cheap tablets on the past for a much higher price and less the quality.

this is the best entry level tablet for kids. cheap and with the amazon free option you can give your kids what they like on your own terms. also consider getting a protective case with it	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i am amazed at this little tablet! i had, and still have, a kindle paper white for 3 years before i dared to try to use it, and after using it i was intrigued by the possibilities. i joined a public library and began reading books for free. when i had trouble downloading some books because they were epub instead of kindle, i decided to look into the fire. this fire cost me 39! amazing. i don't use a smart phone and normally only find myself online at home or someplace where i drag my laptop like a hotel or at starbucks. this little number allows me a lot of flexibility. besides downloading books, i can go online, i can download music from my amazon prime account for free music that i don't want to pay for to get onto my ipod classic. i can hook up the fire to my bose speakers and the sound is great! i already watched a pbs tv show on the fire while waiting to get an oilchange done on my car at the dealership. i added 64 gigs of memory for about 20, thinking that i might build quite a music library on this little machine. since the memory is removable, if the tablet gets deepsixed, no problem transferring the music elsewhere, i think! i have almost figured out how to get the music from the fire onto my mac.but maybe it can't be done . i don't know. amazon doesn't let you download from the prime music library to a computer.they only allow the download to tablets and phones. but there must be a way around this.i think it's been fun trying to figure it all out. on the downside, i hate the fact that the screen is not an antiglare screen to begin with, but i bought something which i think will solve that problem. don't like the fingerprints . i'm trying to get used to the notion of a touchscreen. i'm old.i don't like change.so adapting is not that easy. but i'm working on it and i would say for the money, even adding the cost of the accessories i purchased, that this was a worthwhile meander into the realm of mobile connectivity. i'm having a lot of fun with it! the tablet does subject one to advertising when you open it.but i ignore it. i ignore all advertising everywhere so it's not hard for me to do.it's a wellingrained habit. if i were forced to look at and read the advertising however, then i would consider a more expensive tablet that is free of advertising. but for the money you have to make allowances for commerce, i guess. i'm an apple person so i felt this would be very hard to figure out, but it's pretty intuitive after about 4 hours of making endless mistakes! lol. i said i was old.don't expect to know what you are doing right away if you are essentially a technological idiot. thing is you can figure it out. i don't read instructions so maybe if someone were more willing to have things explained to them it would be a shorter learning curve. but i only learn by trial and error. have fun! buy the thing.it's so cheap that if you hate it it's no big loss! the screen adjustments for reading are good.font size, background color, etc. i needed to have something that was easy on the eyes.this works for me!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i purchased this tablet for my grandkids and it was so easy to setup and also operate. they liked it so much that i will probably purchase two more so each grandkid will have their own.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i've been using a kindle forever, and when it became apparent i needed an android device i have a windows phone, which i love but has serious app limitations i thought i with a fire i could get a tablet and upgrade my kindle at the same time. but even with geek squad help i could never figure out how to upload the apps i needed onto the fire. so back it went, replaced with a lenovo tablet that does the trick.

i had the original kindle fire 8.9 inch and then upgraded to the kindle fire 10"". i purchased one of these as a gift for a couple of family members. i setup these tablets and i was surprised that for the price how fast it was and it has the same apps and pretty much functionality of my 10"". the screen resolution isn't as good as a higher priced tablet. but, for 49 it's great! even if you have a tablet already this makes for a good one just to throw in the bag with you when your out and about. i use kindle tablets primarily for media and entertainment purposes amazon prime movies, netflix, hulu, and the news stand.	27in FHD Monitor
my husband set the kindle for our grandson and he just loves it. now he can read every day as well as play games, also he watches videos.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i had a kindle fire 3rd gen and i liked it a lot, but this one is better. i like the sd card slot for extra memory or to move pics from camera to kindle, book reading is great, i don't do many videos, but those i have watched seem to be fine. graphics are good. small enough to fit in my bag on the go, but big enough that i am able to type easily. would recommend.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
cheap and best product from amazon. almost 6 tabs bought recently. this shows how i am inspired with tables	Apple Airpods Headphones
so, i pretty much got this as a cheap tablet for my 2 year old. he's constantly snagging people's cell phones to play games. we figured this was inexpensive enough that if he breaks out in the next two years, it's still better than if he breaks one of our phones on contact. overall, it's a great little tablet for the money, and we can set parental controls on it so it can grow with him over the next few years. not bad.	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased three for my children and so far it's been a little over a month and they are still fully intact and bright and working. the speakers are loud, quality of the housing is very durable and the screen isnt scratch resistant but a screen protector can handle that. charging is quick and the port is still very durable. the volume and home button is easy to handle and the response of the screen is still very well. the colors of the screen with games and movies is awesome. children love it and my husband and i do as well. we catch ourselves playing as well. lol	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i bought the kindle fire 7 for a media source for my music since it was cheap, the only problem i've found so far is there isn't a good music player to download, if anyone knows of a good one please comment if possible. i also use amazon music app. i wish this had bluetooth capabilities but for 50 it can be forgiven.probably a good tablet for kids, i wish i would've just bought a samsung, asus, or lenovo tablet instead but really this is pretty good	Bose SoundSport Headphones

bought one for myself and my younger sister. if you don't want or need to spend a couple hundred on an ipad or something like that, this is a really good deal. i enjoy using it a lot, and so does my younger sister. doesn't have all the fancy things the more expensive ones do, but it's not bad for the price.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i love it, very user friendly! great for the kids, lots of aps, great purchase and great price!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this was actually an impulse purchase, i was out for the weekend and forgot my kindle so i picked up one of these. it works so much better than you'd expect from a budget tablet, the screen is very responsive to touch and has good color reproduction. unless your looking at the screen from just a couple inches away the pixels aren't overly distracting and the text is reasonably sharp.this is a device you can carry around and not be too upset if it gets lost or damaged, and it's a good ereader and cheaper than the epaper models, oddly enough.	Lightning Charging Cable
little slow booting up, but its good starter tablet.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i have the old kindle that is similar to this but was alot more. for the price this is a steal. i will buy a couple more for gifts. the only real complaint is the speaker is a little weak so invest in headphones or a plug in speaker.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought this as an adjunct to an older kindle and so that i can also access four email accounts easily from one place while traveling. screen is bright and makes reading easy. item is small enough to get into my carryon bag and i can pull it out and read emails from my personal accounts and my business accounts. i have also purchased the extra memory to download more movies.

i wasn't looking for a new tablet when i saw this one for 40. with its capability, i couldn't pass it up. it's perfect for ereading, my kids can play games on it, and it functions great. it won't be a replacement for my ipad 3, but it serves it purpose well.	Wired Headphones
i bought four of these for my children to replace the rca tablets that no longer worked. they load much faster and the battery last longer on a single charge. the are very durable and worth the money!	Lightning Charging Cable
purchase this tablet for my brother who is handicapped. mostly so you can watch videos off of youtube. pretty easy for him to understand how to use a tablet. quality of the screen and speakers are pretty decent. really good value for how much it costs.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
it was so slow and problematic i couldnt even get in to the store. switched to a samsung and we love it!	USB-C Charging Cable
this would be a great deal due to the good price for an better than entry level android tablet. but. it is impossible to play music from google play on it. only amazon! that's ok, since is their business, but should make that cleat to not waste time to buy and return it if you have a short budget and don't care about being attached to amazon only, this tablet is for you.	Wired Headphones
i bought one of these for me and my son. they are great tablets for the price. the resolution is great! obviously you aren't getting the speed of a 600 or 700 tablet but i was surprised at how quick they were. i will continue to buy every new amazon fire tablet that comes out. you can't beat it for the price and you can upgrade every year if they make a new one. you could upgrade every year for more than 10 years for the price of one ipad.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i love my amazon fire tablet. it's the perfect size to carry in my purse. i shopped around and compared prices prior to my purchase. best buy had the lowest price and their customer service was excellent.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

super easy to use and small enough to carry in my purse	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i wasn't looking for anything complicated just something to read books on, play a few games, watch videos. at those things it does very well.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is an excellent tablet to have if you aren't looking to spend too much. doesn't have tons of features, however, it has the main basics music, web browsing, email, videomovies, gaming, and reading. plus, if your an amazon prime member, you can get great games for free like real racing 3, and ducktales. also, great as a young child's tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
the system is a little slow and then if you get the one with the offers, they slow down your reading a bit. but, you can't beat the price. this is not a full tablet. it' an ereader with a lot of enhanced functions.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i bought this as a birthday gift a few weeks before the party. when it was removed from package and turned on, the image was cracked like the screen was broken, but screen was not broken. best buy washed their hands of it and said to call amazon. i did and had to go through over a week's worth of calling them to get it replaced. best buy lost me as a customer over this. if you buy this from them, make them open it before you pay to verify it works.

i was in a best buy store when i saw the tablet on display with a sale tag indicating a price of 39.99. i bought it simply based on price. i have a desktop computer, two laptops, two ipads. in other words, i am computer poor. i use this tablet on airplanes to read books, access email, play games, confirm reservations. it is fast, highly portable and easy to use. the battery does last too long but that is not a problem. it is, after all, a 40 tablet. i bought several to give as gifts to nieces and nephews. it is a good computer for kids to use when learning.

Bose SoundSport Headphones
i really like my kindle fire. just make sure that when you get a free month of amazon prime that you cancel it before it expires otherwise you will be charged over 100.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
after purchasing 4 amazon fire tablets i immediately noticed the amount of advertisement they came with at the pricing of the tablet that i bought. there's always some kind of advertisement on the screen when it wakes up. my other issue is after adding a card to make a few purchases for some apps for my kids. i removed the ability to make purchases without a password, well that did not actually happen. for a few days my children were able to make purchases in apps without any props that said are you sure or asking for a password. i've had to completely remove the accounts and reinstall a different account for them to be able to stop making purchases. i also had them transfer the purchases to the new email a big hassle. overall the tablet works good great for the kids.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
need a cheap alternative to a tablet, this is it !	Lightning Charging Cable
this was the best thing to happen for me and my family with the way you can set up the kid mode is awesome and the overall functionality of it is very easy	Wired Headphones

it's not bad especially considering the price.i would recommend	Wired Headphones
i had no idea that this device would be so much fun to use. it's not an ipad mini but in many respects works just as well. it is the best 50 i've ever spent. i was able to root this tablet and install a custom rom which makes this even better. its nice to know that you do not have to spend a fortune for a big name brand device to get the same quality android experience.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
very good price for this tablet. it is a gift for my son.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is way more than expected! i purchased it for my 8 year old daughter to play minecraft on and she hasnt complained yet!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
only 40 you can't beat it. touch screen is a little janky but nothing a stylus cannot cure can also add media via microdisk and outfit with kodi and its a wrap	Wired Headphones
my laptop broke so i needed something so for the price i couldn't go wrong.	iPhone
this tablet is fast, expendable and cheap! it runs the android os, which houses most of the games and apps you'll find on any android phone. my only complaints with this tablet are the screen and cameras. the screen becomes washed out at a 45 degree angle or more and the cameras are unusable due to the noise they produce. otherwise, this is a really great product!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
over all, my grandchildren are happy with their tablets.	20in Monitor
this is amazing for the price. i purchased this for a teenager and he loves it.	Product
does everything and more.very easy to operate and set up.	USB-C Charging Cable
i started the set up process and it automatically pulled over the ebooks i had on my ipad app. then i started adding more books. just wish i would have bought more memory!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bargain for the price. long battery life. the screen quality is good. i use this tablet everyday.	iPhone
i like the size and quality of the picture screen. user friendly, and apps are good. nice to have a library at your fingertips.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i got it for my kids and they love it they play with it every day	USB-C Charging Cable
great tablet for the money and basic media. i enjoy it for reading, audible, and streaming video. uses amazon app store which uses google play. thousands of apps!	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought it for my 4 year old nephew. he is able to use it with ease. its a great product for the pirce	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
its a good product but the os is kind of slow.also when connected to the internet it will sometimes disconnect itself.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

ipad without the bells and whistles. the parental controls are good, but a bit confusing. haven't had the time to sit down and sort it out	AA Batteries (4-pack)
brought for my four year old he loves it has no problems using it at all	USB-C Charging Cable
i was excited to get this because of the price. after taking it home i started noticing things that bothered me. i use samsung devices and the amazon app store does not have a lot of the same apps. even chrome would not work on this device. i did return this because i was looking for more than a bare stock tablet. but if that's what your looking for its great!	Wired Headphones
very portable. easy to use. well worth the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a ok tablet, worth 50 is a little slow, but for the money it's ok	Lightning Charging Cable
even though the price of the tablet matters the display and resolution should have been much better. feels like working in the tablet without the charger connected. amazon disappointed me with this product. minor issues in installing the apps which are available in ios too.	iPhone
great product purchased for my elderly parents. very user friendly and inexpensive!	USB-C Charging Cable
my son's already each had one. got one for my husband. great value, and all are reading more than they ever did.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this device as a dedicated reader with the occasional web browsing and video streaming and i am very happy with it for that purpose. it is the right size and the right weight. the amazon case sold separately gives it a real book feel. if you are looking for more multipurpose use, you may find this device frustrating especially if you have invested in google's ecosystem. the device runs on fire os amazon's flavor of android and app purchases are made through amazon's app store. google play store and google services are not available on this device, and the most essential google apps e.g. youtube are not available in amazon's app store. that said, it's still an excellent device for this price point.	Lightning Charging Cable
my nieces and nephews love it. even my 40 yrs old cousin got one and he is thrilled about it. really easy to use.	USB-C Charging Cable
comfortable to hold while reading, not easy to rotate.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
great tablet and great price that i purchase 3 for all my children. they have no complaints. and if it breaks i can easily afford buying a new one.	Lightning Charging Cable
does the job for a 50 dollar tablet. i used it to watch movies and music. worked great for that. get it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is good to browse the web, check emails, watch youtube videos,. the screen is small but still bigger than any smartphone.it's a bit slow but it's a good bang for the buck.big drawback no access to google play and no support for chromecast if you want to cast to your tv.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought it on sale for 10 less than buying it from amazon, my only complaint would be that i should have grabbed 2 instead of just one!	Wired Headphones
a great buy for the money. very easy to set up and use. i recommend to anyone looking for a small tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
build quality very impressive, this is not a cheap feeling device. it has a nice weight, and is very solid feeling.	iPhone
i was looking for something basic to read on before bed and this fit the bill perfectly. bonus it has camera lol	Apple Airpods Headphones
you really can't go too wrong with this purchase because of the price. works very well, but don't expect ipad quality. does everything i've asked of it, but some web pages are harder to read partially because of it's small size which can be handy and it's lower resolution. it's a good second tablet and is better watching a movie on, then a smaller phone. can throw it in a small travel bag and not feel you have to be quite so careful with it as you might be with a more expensive tablet.	Macbook Pro Laptop
great product perfect for my needs at home. used for my tv remote to roku, radio apps wireless connection to my sound bar and fast browser all in one. i only paid 35 for this device brand new from best buy.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very helpful for keeping fitness, health and weight goals	Google Phone
there are definitely better tablets out there but being able to read books, surf the internet and play games for 50 is a no brainer.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a simple tablet light and very portable for a child. there are many free apps available and they work fine on this tablet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i really enjoy my ereader. it is light, and easy to use.	iPhone
would be nice with some simple start up directions and links to website hints.	USB-C Charging Cable
can't say anything bad about it. great price and a great deal. does everything that my grandfather needs such as reading, internet and fun games to pass time.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
good price. battery life is good for a color tablet but you have to learn to charge more often after being used to a white pages tablet that does not use the same power.	Wired Headphones
ii like that you can undo emails, if you accidentally deleted them.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for my niece and she loves it. she can read all the books she wants and it is a perfect size.	Apple Airpods Headphones
if your looking for a tablet to surf internet, facebook, emails, etc. than this is it. i can watch crystal clear movies through app netflixinfinity live tv and shows. no tablet out there to beat this 39.99 product. so far so good!	ThinkPad Laptop
everything started out great, but then about 9 days into owning the fire, could not locate wifi, doesn't work without wifi	Lightning Charging Cable
bought it for hubby and he loves it. the micro sd slot for more download space is great for movies and games. it also allows him to remote him in to his computer when he is away from home with an app.	ThinkPad Laptop
i initially wanted to buy a kindle but couldn't pass up the great deal and thought i could exchange it if i changed my mind. it works great and has plenty of memory for what i needed, which was strictly to read. i liked that i could also watch netflix on it. the only downside for me is that unlike the kindle i can't read it in the sun, but that's not that much of an inconvenience so far. overall i've been very happy with it.	USB-C Charging Cable
great basic tablet !lightweight and durable .great buy!	USB-C Charging Cable
by far the best small tablet for the money that i could ever find. i bought one for my niece three years ago and she absolutely loves it a great buy.	iPhone
this is a great tablet for the price, works a lot like an ipad i would recommend it	Wired Headphones
this tablet has a great price but don't let that fool you. the tablet performs much lower that other tablets i've used.	Apple Airpods Headphones
vs. kindle fire hd v.8.5 for the price, pretty darn cool. lot faster than my old fire hd. don't like the display screen to much app clutter. wifi not the best for speed connection tested over 4 connections. allinall . . for reading, kids, an easy device, and fast . . yea, it is good buy. just don't expect miracle speed, a lot of bellsandwhistles, or anything fancy. i like it. imho.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

when you buy an amazon product from best buy they will not take responsibility after two weeks and said to speak to amazon directly,but you cannot return any amazon products bought from best buy to amazon, do not buy amazon products from best buy but ever again as you are doomed with it	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i purchased this as a temporary tablet after my old one died. now, i have no desire to buy a different tablet any time soon. for the price, it is great. it does everything that i require a tablet to do, especially after paying the 15 on amazon to disable ads. well worth the price.

purchased for my wife so she can play games and not tie up her phone. seems to play her games alright. it is a bit slow when opening things like the internet, facebook or netflix. still a decent little tablet for 39.99. also limited to amazon app store, so a lot of android apps are not available like dice with buddies.

i find this satisfies my desire for a book reader and small tablet at an excellent price 39.95 on special sale. it is a version of android, and will take many but not all android apps. actually, i haven't used many conventional android apps with it, and none of them has failed to work. i have been able to use bluetooth accessories such as keyboard and powered external speaker. i would buy this again, and actually have. but the second time is as a gift.

the fire 7 is the best low priced android tablet in my opinion. the lack of memory is kind of disappointing, but it does have a micro sd slot and for the price you can't expect all high end features.	Apple Airpods Headphones

Lightning Charging Cable
got the tablet while it was on sale. great choice.	iPhone
i ended up returning it, but it's nothing really wrong with the device itself. despite the low specs, it was mostly responsive and pretty snappy, though i've owned better. i'm just not super invested in the amazon ecosystem, so i was missing things that other tablets have access to, like nookkobo stores, microsoft office, and the like. good choice for a kid's tablet just because it's small and you won't cry much if you lose or break it.	Macbook Pro Laptop
wish tablet was voice capable. only problem was how long it took for the merrillville, in store to restock. they ran out at christmas. it took about 2 months before they were available again.	Google Phone

this tablet is a great back up tablet for the money.	27in FHD Monitor
it isn't blazing fast.but fine for streaming music to a bluetooth device. hey.for 39 at bb i'm not complaining. amazon appstore somewhat limited, but you can download android .apk apps like firefox, opera browser,etc that work fine. silk browser can be speeded up a bit with settings adjustments. buy a class 10 microsd card they're soo cheap now because you only get 8gb onboard and will get used up real fast. wireless not dual band so forget 5g, but does have decent range. people say screen resolution not fantastic, but i've watched many a network show with tw cable app and hd is pretty decent.

it's a wonderful tablet and ereader for what you pay. my only complaint is it's a little laggy and the screen is sometimes unresponsive. i also don't like that i can't put my ebooks on my memory card. it's frustrating. other than that, it's wonderful.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
using it for my 5 years daughter. she is handling very easily without much supervision	Wired Headphones
i wanted a cheap ereader that i could use also as an android tablet if i wanted to. this fitted the bill, especially as a daily deal. it does what i wanted it to and at a very good price.	USB-C Charging Cable
these are great little tablets when you get a working one. i had to call amazon to return 3 times because they kept sending new faulty ones. dead pixels on 3 out of 5 fires and also the screen had yellow tint and looked blown up or zoomed in making the text blurry. i had to keep 2 of the yellow tinted ones because that was better than dead pixels. i just ordered 2 more fires and hoping i don't get the same problems.other than that they work super fast and the feel is sturdy and of high quality and makes it feel better in your hand than an ipad mini. we love this fire! i have a transformer, ipad mini retina, sony reader, kindle hd 8.9, a note 4, a sony z3, iphone 6s, galaxy s3 and s4 and lg g4 to compare with.overall, this tablet is the perfect size and will not disappoint. and the new os is much nicer than the older kindles.

i would have to say that i've been impressed with this entry level tablet from amazon, i personally really enjoy my kindle hdx which is a much higher class of tablet then this one, but for the kids this tablet has been perfect. good battery life, enough performance and storage for reading and entertainment and at less than 50 it has the quality that you can't find in the knock off brands at the same price point . and when caught on sale you can sometimes even get this little ereader for less than 40. well worth every penny.	Lightning Charging Cable
i've had a previous kindle before, and it needed to be replaced. i'm glad i put it off.until this gem happened to come out. i still can't believe that for the price of a random, often low quality tablet done that too you get.a kindle. yes, it's a smaller screen and not quite hd like i've been spoiled with, but the resolution is still fantastic, the speed is amazing, and customer service if it needs to be looked at has a turn around of 23 days. i had a minor issue with preparing of microsd apps being slow, but i just decided to deal with it.	iPhone
it's easy to use and downloading apps for learning and educational resources are very easy. i will recommend this tablet to everyone for their child.	Wired Headphones
bought this for my son and he is enjoying it everyday. user friendly	iPhone
i really like this tablet but, i was amazed by the weight of it compared to my wife's 6"" kindle tablet. the 7' version is quite a bit heavier which makes it a bear to hold for long periods. other than that, it's great!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love this tablet because it is simple and portable. easy to carry!	Bose SoundSport Headphones

good tablet for day to day use. not for those who want hd everything but shows decent video in sd.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the tablet is good for the price is really being sold	34in Ultrawide Monitor
the fire is a decent pad for basic uses. the only downside is the way the fire automatically links with your amazon account. also the ads are annoying and clearly designed to increase your amazon purchases more than anything else.	27in FHD Monitor
this is an excellent tablet for someone who just needs something simple and doesn't want to spend a lot of money. one of my favorite features is the fact that there is a memory card slot, which means that you can have virtually endless memory. this was an important feature for me since my ipad does not allow that.	Wired Headphones
the speed the great. the kindle fire has a lot of apps to choose from and has not frozed on me yet. once you figure out the parental control, it works great with unwanted charges.	ThinkPad Laptop

i have four siblings and it keeps them quiet days they're home	27in FHD Monitor
we switched from an older model tablet to this simplified kindle fire. for the price, it is a decent reader, which is primarily what we were seeking, but it has its limitations.the primary user in the house used it to read before bed. he feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright, so he defaults his booksdocuments to black screen. however, words in italics default to the screen background, which means they are black. doh!he also doesn't like the persistence of the washington post popping up on his home screen. he finds it a bit annoying. however, he doesn't mind the ads and suggested content from amazon at all. it is just the washington post that he doesn't like.beyond those minor things, it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader. being amazon prime customers, we share content between our accounts with ease now that we both are on kindle platform.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it is perfect for everything i need to be able to do on the go.	USB-C Charging Cable
i ordered this tablet as a cheap replacement for my niece, but quickly found out how well made the tablet is. not only that the version of android it uses is smoother than i expected. nice tablet.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

wanted a nice reader, this is it for under 50!	27in FHD Monitor
i purchased this item during the black friday at best buy, not only was it dirt cheap at the time of the purchase, but my kids also love it as well. the great thing is that i am also able to monitor what they download and purchase without me having to get the tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
if your not sure of what your needs are.the fire is a good place to start.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it's a good little tablet but just a little annoying because of the ads on the lock screen to make us have to pay more for the tablet to get a tablet that doesn't have the ads on the lock screen is kind of ridiculous. so for that reason i only gave it 4 stars it's a good tablet does what they say it does but don't like the fact that you have to pay extra to get a tablet that is ad free.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very happy with the overall design and the many options the fire has as far as the ability to assess different apps	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i bought this for my granddaughter so she could have it to watch movies and play games. she loves it and takes it everywhere she goes. it is way better than a leap pad and it can grow with her.	Google Phone
it is a cheap tablet. it is not for you but a very good option for little kids	Wired Headphones
i purchased the tablet for my son and he has pleasantly delighted with it up to this point.	iPhone
great tablet fast and great resolution. great with prime membership	Lightning Charging Cable
easy access to books and the web, just annoying ads.	USB-C Charging Cable
i really regret taking so long purchasing the kindle fire. the ipad was being so hyped up to the point that i didn't think the kindle was as good. however, the ipad is not as good because after a few years, it no longer takes updates. what's the since in purchasing such an expensive item if it can't accept lifelong updates? that was the purpose of me getting a tablet instead of a regular computer.	Wired Headphones
well worth the money, it's just a pretty well thought out tablet, the interface is designed well enough for a child to a grandmother to use with relative ease.it's also powerful enough to play a great variety of fun, good looking games. which is pretty amazing at this price point.	Wired Headphones
average good 4 playibg games has a tendency to freeze	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased this for my mother to use primarily to check facebook and watch netflix. i was a little bit disappointed to find out that there was not a vudu app available. i hope that one is in the development stages. i knew that this was not a full out tablet when i bought it, but had hoped that since it was based on android, it would have the major android apps.

for the money, this is one of the nicest kindle readers i have seen. this is so powerful, i can do a lot more than read books.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is my first tablet, and i have had for just a short while. so far, it seems to be a great product for the price. i plan to use it primarily as a reader, which will allow me to stop accumulating books in my small apartment! so the small form factor seems to fit that purpose, and it's a bonus to have a browser and the availability of lots of apps too.	Lightning Charging Cable
not the best tablet out there by amazon, bt definitely worth the price. can do all the basic functions of an android tablet. great for media and entertainment purposes.	Wired Headphones
we bought the amazon fire for my daughter. works great	Lightning Charging Cable

my kindle fire has been easy to use and allows me to read several books and magazines at a time with out the clutter.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love this tablet,great for reading and keeping up with my emails.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i mainly use this tablet to read my kindle books on but it also handles playing music and watching videos fine. great for social media as well. a perfect first tablet for someone who has yet to experience a tablet or smart mobile technology. definitely buy a decent sized micro sd card when you get it though, as the real space you receive after purchase is more like 4 gb because the os takes so much space on the device.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great easy to use tablet! very affordable!	USB-C Charging Cable
bought to use as a reader on flights. lightweight, great reader, more functionality than i would have expected for the price	Wired Headphones
i purchased this because i can add memory to it.and it's the best kindle i've bought so far this is about the fifth one i've purchased.i like it so much that i bought one for my kids as well!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my 9 year old. she loves it! very durable and easy to use. price is great!	Wired Headphones
i bought it for granddaughter so she would leave my tab alone and it worked my tab is mine again	Wired Headphones
was looking for a simple tablet to use during my commute. this fits the bill. app store is limited, but this is good for simple web surfing or watching videos. lightweight too. only thing i don't like are the ads on the unlock screen but, this is minor considering the price.	iPhone
the kindle fire 7"" is a very nice reader. i love how small and light it is.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
for the price, this tablet is great! does what is needed and its sleek.	ThinkPad Laptop
i've had this tablet for a week now and i love it. im not the most gadgetly inclined person but i do know what i wantedneeded from a tablet and i must say my expectations have been met exceeded. when the price drops again to what i paid for it, im definitely buying another. christmas shopping never starts too early!	20in Monitor
bought it for my mom, she like to play games in her tablet is it is perfect.	Lightning Charging Cable
the fire goes where you go. the greatest attribute is the size, perfect to bring everywhere!	USB-C Charging Cable

good for teens that use it primarily for gamingvideos	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this for our 9 year old daughter and she loves it! easy to use and kid friendly.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased one as a christmas gift. from best buy on line.it worked fine the first month,did not use it for a few weeks. i went to turn it on.did not get nothing .the lefthand bottom corner says ""fastbooth mode"" it is locked on this and i get nothing else.did not buy any product protection so i guess it is a complete loss.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
they love it and when they are here that's all they want to do but i do limit their time on it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought for a friend and checked it out after purchase is a very neat machine.	iPhone
i bought this when it was on sale, and my rewards coupon was expiring so i felt i didn't have much to lose. overall, this tablet is a good value, but you have to be careful about certain aspects.the tablet is really fast for something in this price range. the screen has pretty good resolution as well. there is no bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones won't work with it.the app store is the amazon app store. i side loaded google play and am getting my apps from there youtube helpful for instructions. the lock screen is an amazon billboard. the default search is bing instead of google. i haven't figured out how to fix that yet. i just use the google app to search google. you can load the chromecast app from play, but it is hit or miss as to whether it works. it works for youtube and flixter, but it doesn't work for any disney apps watch espn, watch abc, etc.. you can cast the screen and view things that way, but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet's screen.i think it was a good deal since it was cheap, and i can now watch my prime movies on it. still, it's not the tablet you would expect from an android device. my satisfaction would improve greatly if chromecast worked better.	Flatscreen TV
this is the second kindle i have had. this has all the features that i needit has my email, it is easy to read, it is easy to take wherever i go, it also has the books on it that i love to read. it has the further capability of taking pictures and has its own calendar. i recommend it to anyone.	Wired Headphones
hands down you can't go wrong with this tablet. especially if its on sale and lower than the normal 50 retail price. sure some google apps might not be in the market place, but a majority are and if your looking for just another tablet for mobile games or another screen for netflix or hulu this tablet would do just fine.	Apple Airpods Headphones
like it. worth the 50 just wish it only had a real google play store	USB-C Charging Cable
i am using it from nov'15 and have lots of apps and games installed it just never gets hang or slow up.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased one for myself and my mom to use for the word games books to help enhanse her mind.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought it for my son. he loved it. i just don't like he can read my books at amazon. i should be able create a sub account and limit it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
its a good one for the normal songs and video viewing.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
most tablets i've tried really stink, but this one is ok. wish it had google though.	Lightning Charging Cable
wonderful product! user friendly and if help is needed, online support is available.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i bought this for my niece for her 9th birthday and she loves it! i would recommend it if you have kids	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet screen and memory is lackluster at best but other than that if you are replacing another one of the kids tablets or giving a gift to an older family member this is the way to go. the video on amazon website shows a better picture while streaming video, amazon ""one touch"" is turned on automatically so be careful to password protect purchases unless you don't mind a lot of 2.99 purchases. in short they make it too easy to purchase items by mistake. i thought i was on prime video and notice that i was charged for an episode of warehouse 13. since i didn't see the show and caught this quickly i was able to chat with amazon customer care and they walked me through how to change that setting online. this tablet not for me since i'm looking for a higher end media tablet with more memory than the 8gb this unit has.	USB-C Charging Cable
we wanted something you could read books on and watch shows through amazon and hulu. this meets those needs and then some.	Wired Headphones
this is a good product for reading and browsing internet.	27in FHD Monitor
the tablet is just the right size. the games are fun and has so many other uses	Lightning Charging Cable
the ease of the touch screen makes for easy use with arthritis old granny nurse	USB-C Charging Cable
best bang for the buck. can't be beat for reading. the best bookstore and readers experience.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it's ok i would recommend it to friends for sure in the future	Lightning Charging Cable
first off you can't go wrong with the price, 50 or if you can even catch it on sell is a steal for any piece of tech. now i've seen people compare this to an ipad or samsung tablet, which you can't. this doesn't have retina display or anything like that, but for the price point it does a good job. i've had mine since the black firday sell and its still been working really good. i also got one for my mom and my nephew. i generally use mine for emails and amazon orders along with reading the time to time book, netflix, and the few games that i've purchased. my mom and nephew use it mainly to play games. if your looking for retina display or something with apple or andriod features and don't mind the extra 150 or 300 bucks by all means i suggest getting one of the higher end tablets. but i can't complain with this new amazon fire 7 as it works just as good for me. i'd recommend buying a sd card however if you want a little extra space.	USB-C Charging Cable
love my kindle! it's perfect for my netflix obsession late at night! great size and picture quality!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i like the size it fits right in my pocket and its not bulky	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this amazonfire 7 is on fire meaning that it is a hot buy at best buy. it does everything i need it to do. haven't had any problems.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's work very well for a child got for my 8 year old she love it	Flatscreen TV
the tab is very good for the price what is being offered. allows to have separate kid profile as well so that they don't have access to unwanted stuff. youtube app can be installed as well.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this tablet because i didn't want to spend over a 100 on a tablet that would not get much use. i use it mostly to read books and articles online. it has a brightness reducing function which is really great.	Flatscreen TV
one thing i like most about the kindle fire product line are the extensive parental controls. the game play seems to be good and movie playback is as well. my kids love theirs.	Wired Headphones
is a great tablet the only bad thing is the lack of space and you have to buy an sd card for extra space	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased the tablet as a screen for my drink and it worked just fine	Macbook Pro Laptop
i love this tablet for alot of reasons.expandable memory slot of up to 128 mb sd card for music in the car an anywhere.netflix for every1 in the family.perfect for the 3 year olds phonics an movie time.	Lightning Charging Cable

large enough it is not a strain on my child's eyes. in two days my three year old figured it out. great for her to watch her shows and play games. have not used it much past setting it up.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought this to replace a broken tablet hoping it would work for a replacement. unless you are amazon everything. google apps aren't easily installed on this tablet. otherwise it's a great value for the money.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my son had the same model kindle but a year later his kindle had issues. this kindle has a micro sd slot for storage. i haven't tested it out yet. i plan on testing it out to see if i can load movies on the micro sd	Apple Airpods Headphones
when i was looking for something to get so i could have all my books on one the kindle is the first thing i thought of and ended up getting. the only thing i don't like about it is when it is dark the screen can be kind of bright even with the blue shade on. i also i have trouble spelling on the keyboard.	iPhone
its a quick fast little tablet. can do a lot of stuff a normal tablet does.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very good tablet, great options and features for the price.	Flatscreen TV

my motherinlaw loves her tablet! i purchased it at a great price as well.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this isn't a great tablet. obviously. it's not even a pretty good tablet. what it is, is a really solid tablet that, at 35, is basically disposable. i take this thing places where it might get stolen or broken, because if it does. i'm only out 35. consequently i use it a lot more because it's not so precious. also, the ability to download movies from prime and watch them off line, makes this guy the perfect subway tablet.	Wired Headphones
this is a great tablet, if you keep your expectations in check. is it going to rival the likes of the ipad or even the 2013 nexus 7? no. but there is a lot of junk in the 50100 tablet market. thankfully the new kindle fire isn't one of these. the screen quality is adequate for reading and watching youtube, netflix, and hulu. i had multiple apps open and it didn't feel too bogged down. if you can find it when it is on sale for 39.99, it's an even bigger steal.	Wired Headphones
good tablet for simple use like reading books, music and simple tasks.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this tablet for my grandson who loves it. he can download books to read and play games as well. he carries it with him wherever he goes. has really enjoyed having his own tablet.	Wired Headphones

purchased 2 of these black friday from our local best buy and gave them as gifts for xmas. both people thought we spent a lot of money but we made out like bandits for under 40 each. great product ! great gift for not a lot of money for anyone who your considering their first tablet. you can't go wrong here.

movee very slow but it is ok for the price that i paid for it.	Lightning Charging Cable
when my kids play a game on their profile the system goes to the screensaver. my dad's doesn't do this so it may just be a software issue on mine. but altogether i do love having the fire.	Lightning Charging Cable
can not print from this device.using the touch screen is very difficult.	Wired Headphones
as inexpensive as this tablet is, it is a great option for children. each of my kids has one. if they damage it, you aren't out a ton of money like an ipad. freetime is also a great option to help control apps and time each child is on the kindle.	Flatscreen TV
my husband and i each own this kindle. you will never find us without them at hand for gaming or email. my bff always complained that i was addicted. guess what i got herfor a birthday present! so who's the addict now!	Wired Headphones
does everything i need really well. i do both of my email accounts, read all of the news and sports i want, and do light research. it's plenty fast and the screen resolution is just fine. amazing for the price.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i had wanted a kindle for a very long time. when i saw the price i could not resist	Apple Airpods Headphones
of you're looking for a tablet with all the bells and whistles this may not be for you. if your looking for a great reader with easy access to all amazon has to offer at an affordable price this may be what you're looking for.	Wired Headphones
i think this tablet is better for simple usage. not so much for a whole lot of apps and games, as the memory is used up super fast for only being 8gb when in reality you don't get the full 8gb to begin with. i got this for my 7yr old daughter and the apps eat up the memory which eventually slow down the tablet and make it kick off the wifi because there isn't enough memory for it to fully function. you pretty much have to get a memory card for it with atleast 16gb or more. but for a starter and for basic stuff.checking social media etc it's fine. and for a starter tablet for kids.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a great product and i did research it before buying 3 of them. having said that, i didn't realize the apps such as instagram and madden mobile, we're not available on amazon. this was a big disappointing factor for the young people using the product. the other big complaint we have with this product is the length of the charging cord. way too short.	Google Phone
purchased one for my mother who likes to read a lot but not really internet savy. she loves it. and cannot beat the price. she uses it mainly for reading however. i bought it on black friday for under 50.00	Bose SoundSport Headphones
had to return a digiland tablet that i got for my daughter for christmas and best buy didn't have another digiland so they let me get the kindlefire instead of the digiland. my daughter likes it all except for the fact that she can't get the google play games that i have on my tablet.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i picked up this tablet thinking it would be a great buy. i have a few family members that own the previous model of the kindle fire and highly approve of them. the new product i got was very disappointing, the display had a dead pixel on it when i turned it on. the product is very slow and the cameras leave a lot to be desired. i took it back and exchanged for an ipad mini 4 and am very happy with it.	Flatscreen TV
it's not really an android device as everything is amazon centric. not a massive problem unless you want to integrate with google products such as chromecast. you also can't switch off tracking features and use add blockers, the lock screen even has an advert! however if you can put up with that then it is a great little tablet with excellent performance.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
bought this tab for the 40 dollar sale price and its a nice little system. nothing worthy of note though i have to say i am not a fan of the amazons operating system. my wife hates the inability to delete preinstalled bloatware so the homescreen is not ocd friendly.	Wired Headphones
it is a nice tablet for the price. the camera is not that great but it is decent. beware of the memory capacity though. it says that it holds 8 gb but only has 3.81 gb of free space, so less than half.	Wired Headphones
i had purchased a fire hd about a year ago from amazon so this was a second. it is not in constant use, but i can take the pictures of receipts when i need them, and have it as a inexpensive backup. backups are really important.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
luckily best buy exchanged the kindle fire for a lenovo tablet with courtesy and ease. thank you best buy! it was a black friday purchase that i did nothing with until late january early february. great way to do business and therefore keep it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought a gift for my mom. she absolutely loved it! great purchase. great price! no complaints.	Wired Headphones
great display and colors easy to use. very good entry level tab great price seems to be very durable great apps. would recommend to anyone wanting entry level tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is my second purchase of a kindle fire, an upgrade from the original, which failed due to unintentional very rough handing by this user. it is an excellent device with significant improvements over the original. my only issue is that a particular app that i routinely used apparently was only available on the original and is not available on the latest model.	Lightning Charging Cable
we had an older kindle that needed to be upgraded. this is the same quality for less than half the price! love it and has a camera, our old one did not.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my daughter loves her tablet and it's great for movies and games!	AA Batteries (4-pack)

bought these for my 3 college students. they love them	AA Batteries (4-pack)
seamless transition from old device. easy to use. completely happy.	Wired Headphones
if you're expecting something like an ipad, leave your expectations at the door. this is a great little tablet for losing track of time while you read, play a game, connect with familyfriends, or watch a show. i've had ipads for years, and have loved using themjust getting tired of the price tags that come with them.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
love it nice parental controls but be careful screen will crack.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i got it on black friday. its a great tablet for kids or your additional backup tablet for games or reading books. ad's on the lock screen was annoying.	Wired Headphones
this is an amazing item for the money. cheaper then my first scientific calculator many years ago.	Lightning Charging Cable
i have older versions of the kindle fire, and i bought this one to replace my daughter's ""aging"" kindlewhich she uses constantly. this one has 2 camera phones, one rear and one front, compared to her one that has just one rear. also, the graphics are better and it has more mg than her old one, which is great because she pretty much maxed out her other one. she uses it to read, play games, and do homework even can check her grades online. all around, it is quick to turn on rather than using a computer to get what she needs for easy homework online research, calculator, etc. and a lot more portable when traveling!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i like the fire tablet. it is great for checking emails, playing games, etc. without the expensive cost.	Wired Headphones
i bought this for my son to have access to netflix and a few games. although i think the parental controls are too complicated, i really like the tablet.	Macbook Pro Laptop
the processor was so slow. it took about five minutes to load a five minute youtube video with 50 mbmin. internet.	27in FHD Monitor
excellent value great apps and movies. the price was perfect.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this was a good investment. that being said do yourself a favor and buy a sd micro card and add it on before you download anything. makes it run that much smoother	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a great budget tablet. don't expect it to compare to an ipad, but it's great for the kids!	Flatscreen TV
a great tablet to read books on amazon for prime members.	Lightning Charging Cable

seems ok but not what i really needed. i'm not much of a reader	Apple Airpods Headphones

i purchased this tablet after seeing the best buy ad.i got it for my wife for christmas this past december. the price was unbelievable under 50! and even though my wife didn't think she'd ever use or want one, i said, ""what the heck!"" and bought it anyway. well, she's been using it nightly during the week and quite a bit more on weekendsin fact, she's used it more than anything else i've ever given her in the past!

special offers means there are popup ads when you turn on the kindle for games and books. i called amazon and they want me to pay 15.99 to turn this off! i am returning this and buying another brand of tablet. i am done with amazon they will never get a dime from me!	Flatscreen TV

bought this as a gift so i can't speak on how it functions. however, i researched all kinds of tablets online before purchasing this and it was a great deal	Bose SoundSport Headphones

we bought these tablets for our children ages 5 through 10 for gameplay so they could stay off of my samsung tablet. hallelujah! they absolutely love them! the only problem that i have with tablet is the length of the cord on the charger. it's too short. if you want to continue play while it's charging, you have to literally sit right next to the electrical source. we remedied this problem by exchanging the cord for a longer one that we had around the house.	Wired Headphones
it's great each of my kids received one last month for christmas ages 8, 12, 15. we gave it to them mostly for reading and they love them. yes the younger two game on them and watch their shows as well, but most of the time i ""catch"" them reading. i thought the ads would bug them but they only appear when you initially turn on the device and that's it. no one's said a thing. good screen quality too. we purchased a 32g sd card for each tablet for more storage.	27in FHD Monitor
it was pretty cheap and you can surf the web. a good buy for the bucks.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
works okay for what we paid. not super speedy, quality is a little grainy as well	Lightning Charging Cable

great tablet for those new to tablets or just goofing around on	Google Phone
very good and easy to handle the price was very good	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a great tablet and you can't beat the price. i bought it to use with amazon prime videos, but i now find myself using it for much more. the built in email client works great. if you want, and do a little research, it is easy to either side load apps from the google playstore, or install the store app itself, allowing you to install the few apps that don't appear in the amazon app store.	Wired Headphones
the price was right and i wanted it for it's ease, because i will be using it in my door to door ministry. thank you,	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this item is taking forever to charge and not holding the charge. we may have to return. i assume it is this unit and not all.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

this amazon fire tablet is a great tablet and very affordable.	27in FHD Monitor
i bought this for my son's first tablet. i really like the product. like the parental controls. for him i am not thrilled that with any parental controls he can't have free access to the web. it's blocked mostly .needs a bit more memory so get an sd card. i would rate it lower because of this. but for what i paid i just cant. the graphics on netflix are good. i can't come up with one reason for the price to give it less than stars. i own a ipad and it rivals it. especially for the price difference.	Flatscreen TV
very nice tablet. very fast for the price. camera takes good quality pictures.	27in FHD Monitor

this was on such a good deal that i couldn't resist it. i purchased two of these for my 6 and 3 year old children. they don't need anything grand, but this is more than suitable for them to learn, play, and enjoy some technology. it performs well and i hope it continues to last.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this tablet is a really good value. gave it as a gift and it was a hit!	Apple Airpods Headphones
bought these for my kids for the holidays. no you tube app installed, so you have to find a 3rd party substitute. ads pop up all the time, with an option to remove them for 15. amazon states that since i purchased the tablet on sale for 15, this is how they can afford to compensate for that revenue. i would have returned them had we been able to find the receipt.maybe a good product, but not for us.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
good tablet for the price. it is fast, battery life is ok.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this amazon fire table is a great bargain. its not a top of the line table and you can tell since the moment you see the price tag but for that price does a whole lot! day to day regular use or just for kids and people that dont really care about some extra features that flagship tablet bring its amazon!	27in FHD Monitor
great tablet to use around the house, and on the go . my wife like to read alot	iPhone
this is my second one. i love it. the price was great. bought one for my daughter.	Wired Headphones

this tablet is wonderful and a great value. it's performance is fast	LG Dryer
my kids love this tablet! all the fun without the steep price!	Lightning Charging Cable
i have to admit that i was quite surprised by this amazon fire tablet. i have been using apple, windows, and android for the past few years and never gave amazon a chance until a black friday deal at best buy.it is responsive, visually great, and the os is quite easy to navigate. i set this up with my younger son in mind, and the parental controls are superb. they covered everything i could think of to prevent him from doing. amazon also has plenty of cases to choose from for their own tablets.the only thing, and this just may take time, is that i wish the app library was more extensive compared to apple and android. other than that, everything else is excellent!	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought the fire for my 8 year old for school after a suggestion from the sales rep in store. went to set it up and it required a credit card number be entered. couldn't even download free kids apps. why would i want my child able to accidently buy something? i refused and thus not able to download anything. we will be returning it. product appears best for an adult who likes to read books on tablet.	Google Phone
great tablet, we love it, great for family with kids	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the biggest drawbacks to this product is the lack of any instructionsuser manuals included with the package. you are forced to experiment with the controls to boot it up and start using it.if you are adventurous and pc oriented, it's no problem.if you aren't.good luck.	Flatscreen TV
this item is one of the best purchases i made this seasin. i absolutly love it	Wired Headphones

a nice tablet for the price. no alot of meaningful competition at this price range, which makes the fire tablet an easy selection for the price conscious buyer.	Wired Headphones
excellent tablet for beginners and kids. the cameras and expandable memory are a big plus and this tablet is a steal at the price. its not for everyone, you get what you pay for	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is the perfect size and power for any work or home use.	Apple Airpods Headphones

affordable, versatile and easy to use whether it is for ereading or searching the web.	USB-C Charging Cable
it has more features than the old rca tablet she had has more memory battery power plus u can get free ebooks	USB-C Charging Cable
got 2 of these for my grandsons and they love them.	Flatscreen TV
my first real tablet. it works awesome for books and playing movies. even though it is limited to only amazon apps it is fast and has a lot of free apps to play with. if your looking for a tablet to use for mostly internet i would look else where. it is limited to only one browser app that and the music play pack through headphones is kind of weak at least for my taste. movies look play great which is one of the things i wanted it for. good battery life and overall quality. so for the price this is hard to beat.	ThinkPad Laptop
i bought five of these for ages 4 to 14. they all loved them and were up and using them within 5 minutes. was their favorite gift!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this new kindle is very well built. finally amazon got away from making the kindles use a carousel to browse through apps. the speakers are of great quality and are very loud. this kindle is also extremely durable compared to nearly every tablet on the market. i've dropped this about 5 times already on my tile floor and there is virtually no damage.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good basic tablet for home and the kids. the only downside is that a credit debit card is required to link to the amazon store even if you download a free app. i'm able to let the kids use apps and the internet. i can limit the sites the kids can visit and apps they can use.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i got this for my friend for christmas she was thrilled when she got it! i have an older one use it all of the time. very pleased with this product!	Macbook Pro Laptop
this is the best tablet i have ever owned. everyone in my house now have one. lightweight and perfect for reading ebooks, playing games or just about anything. it even has parental controls. very easy to use.	Flatscreen TV
this tablet is showing it's age. i bought one for my 10 year old back when he was 7 and it was cool then. picked up two on sale for my 4 and 5 year old so they can leave my phone alone and they like it. however it's slow when downloading apps and i constantly have to plug in my pin. battery life isn't that great either especially when they stream movies so i still have to give up my phone . overall still a decent product hood picture and they like it.	Wired Headphones
i bought it for a gift and the recipient loves it!	USB-C Charging Cable
great little tablet for taken on my commute to work.	USB-C Charging Cable
the main reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's no ipad. it will be great for kids mostly. the screen quality is not the best.	iPhone
we love this tablet for our toddler. the built in parental controls are awesome. just wish that it was open to android market outside of amazon for more apps.	Lightning Charging Cable
another good buy for my daughter! youngest one too! she enjoys being on it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use for my nontech sister! screen is a little small, but it works for what she needs. great value on ""black friday.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my requirement for this tablet was reading kindle ebooks and watching netflix. i don't play games and no need of browsing on the table too. bought it tablet on bf for 35 and found it to be a good value for reading. the only problem i faced is a couple of updates i received lately which have slowed down the performance a bit that's why 4 stars. watching netflix is also good on this tablet.overall worth the 35 i paid for it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
got it for daughter christmas they love it, i haven't figured out how to run it yet.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

the navigation on the tablet is easy to use. its great for streaming movies. light weight and compact.	Lightning Charging Cable
first of all i like the price ! faster and take good photos	27in FHD Monitor
extremely worth the money. also with kindle they offer the underground app which gives you completely free games with in app purchases that are free. the same games cost 5 to 20 bucks on android and the apple store.for the price you cannot get a better tablet, i have had many tablets and for 50 bucks you can't go wrong.

that's an average tablet, with considerable specs for the price, it stars fast, run apps fast, and the battery lasts for a while, around 4 hours of average use.the only limitation for me is that it doesn't have google store.if you have bought any app from that store, you'll have to buy them again from amazon store.but there are tutorials online teaching how to have google app store working on this tablet.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

at first i didn't think this equipment was of much value when someone pointed it out to me. however after i got to thinking about it, i considered how much easier it would be to use as opposed to the keyboard. after using it, i've found that's not only is it much easier faster, it's much more accurate as well.

granddaughter loved it! it was a present for christmas.	Wired Headphones
i purchased this tablet because i saw that it was at an affordable price point for me. with this, it's really not that bad. the only 2 things i've found to be able a little bit annoying is that it's a little awkward to holdhandle when i'm playing my games. the second issue i've found with this type of tablet is that it's made out of plastic its noisy. the overall performance is quite impressive though. good price point, with good intentions, just a little cheap feeling a little big in the hands to hold.

not as good as the first kindle fire i got and ok product.	Wired Headphones
i like it for my kids and think it is a great tablet for adults too	Apple Airpods Headphones
i ordered this as i had already purchased one for myself and i found that my 4 year old son could use it quite easily and loved the games on it. i also has purchased the 2 year no questions asked insurance. i like that i can set time limits, when the device can wake and when it can sleep. how much time should be spent for educational work vs play or movies. i like the heft of it and not having to worry how much it costs in case either of my children decide to throw it across the room. i have a child with autism and learned the hard way that electronic devices can become air borne in a moments notice for no reason at all. so i am no longer willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a tablet.also, i had purchased a galaxy tab 4 and found that i couldn't use amazon apps on the secured profile side unless i installed the app on ""that"" side which would give my children access to purchasing apps. i was not going to do that which rendered any amazon apps useless on the galaxy tab 4. i also found that my older son wanted the amazon apps from the amazon underground store that my youngest son was playing. when i looked on google play for them, those same apps to put on the tab 4 were 10 a piece! being they were disney apps. well, this tablet has virtually paid for itself in my opinion and now both my children are happy. i have insurance on both so i am not worried about them breaking them. i don't have to match 10 apps on another device. my children read books and watch movies, or play apps, so the internet isn't really a concern, as it is a little slow but not painful.overall, i definitely would buy it again and i would recommend it. very happy with my purchase as it suits my needs.	iPhone
perfect for beginners or for anyone that wants great tablet at a great price although it's cheaper than when the original was released it still has the same greatness as it's predecessors for 1 forth of the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

can't find a better tablet for the price, apple should take a page from the amazon book	USB-C Charging Cable
counting back, this is my 5th kindle since they came out. i've never had to replace one that ""died"", but sometimes i want the newer features. this one is to replace the older ""books only"" unit that is starting to be uncooperative that i take to work for reading during lunch. i'd have probably just gotten another ""reading only"" unit, like a paperwhite, but these were less expensive.pluses, can carry movies, music, etc, like my kindle hd fire. can easily let me shop on amazon, can access free ""underground"" apps, i really don't need it for games though, and it is simple to use.minus, uses power quickly, like the kindle fire hd, i have to charge it daily to every other day. i set a password very highly recommended, to prevent unauthorized uses or purchases. it has given me minor problems with books by marking that i was on a different page than where i stopped, and it ""links"" to the other kindles and they go to that page as well. for some reason, accessories, like cases are more expensive. if you want to store a good deal more, you require an sd chip, 11 for 32 gb.	Wired Headphones
this was a good proce and does what it needs too for the price!	Wired Headphones
i bought this tablet because it was on sale and i had heard it was a good entry level tablet. it is quick on the touch response. camera is decent but not the best. its good to view videos.	Flatscreen TV

you can't go wrong for 50.00 the only thing is that the graphics and speed aren't the best.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

it's great for kids at this price, not its not an ipad. can only buy from kindle, so apps are somewhat limited. this edition added a sd slot to add storage!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a competent tablet at a bargain price. unfortunately it is crippled by a useless operating system. amazon's take on android essentially removes all functionality that makes android great, to force you to use their services and apps instead of google's.if you're a tinkerer or don't mind doing some software hacking, this is a pretty easy fix. you can hack google's apps and services back into it, resulting in an amazing, and amazingly cheap android tablet.unless you're willing to do, or hire someone to do, those software modifications, you'll probably be disappointed. if you are, it'll be the best cheap tablet you'll ever own.it looks like it might be great for kids, even in its stock state. i don't have kids, so i could not test that. but i added a star for that possibility.unmodified 2 starsmodified 5 stars	Lightning Charging Cable

first amazon fire tablet, previously had a first gen kindle, love this tablet and cannot beat the price 35!working wonderfully	Wired Headphones
the amazon fire 7 tablet is a great tablet for the money got it during black friday for 35, but even at 50 is still a good deal. you can get most apps on the amazon underground store for free, and most addons for the apps are even free, compared to .99 cents each for apple devices. only drawback for my preference, is that there isn't a facetime app to videochat with other apple device users with. other than that, pretty much any other ios app is available for the amazon fire. videos play very well, not hd quality, but not bad either. this is a great tablet for anyone looking for a portable device to browse the internet, check emails, facebook, etc, and for the price, it can't be matched by any other tablet on the market.

this amazon fire tablet is an excellent barebones tablet that is great for checking email and surfing ineternet keeping tabs on facebook and twitter! at 50 bucks ya can't go wrong!	Wired Headphones

it was the cheapest tablet, but still very useful considering it was for my toddler. wanted something that i could play child shows from youtube and some learning games from apps. wish there were more apps for him, but i'm sure with time amazon will have a few more i'd like to see just as apple does. when not in use, from time to time it works great for the needs i may have if i want a bigger screen than my iphone or don't feel like booting up a laptop. the only downfall is that when it's locked, it displays ads for games. i found out this is due to keeping the price so low for the tablet.

you can't beat what you get out of this tablet for the money. easy to download play store and install actual apps.pros price, ease of use, expandable storage, battery life.cons screen resolution, low ram, not for high powered games.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i absolutely love this tablet,with a price you cant beat!	Lightning Charging Cable
for the price, it's tough to complain but it does occasionally stutter or get slow downs. overall, you can't find a tablet at this price that will outperform but if you do have the extra money, i would use it for the new fire hd 8 instead.	Wired Headphones

reason i wouldn't give it a full five stars is because of the fact that is so loaded down with adware for amazon but an awful lot of that is what makes it affordable so 49 can't beat it	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it is a excellent tablet for the price. works great. no issues and complains.	Lightning Charging Cable
it is little slow at start up. but once its up. it works great. for the price, it is a great device. i play basic games, they run smoothly.	iPhone
kindle fire is good because of the other things you can do besides just reading books. but it is slow and hard to read in sun.	Wired Headphones
it's exactly what you would expect for a tablet under 100. very basic. screen resolution if sub par for what's out today. speed is questionable but works for our 2 year old.	USB-C Charging Cable

works great until. i had forgotten that amazon fire did not come with google playstore. i looked up how to add playstore to the 7"" fire. there are many videos on youtube that showed how to add playstore to the fire. all seemed to add it ok but the loss performance of the fire was noticeable. there were several apps that failed to work at all or lost features. one example was lifetime. it was slow to load and failed to bring up chromecast. one reason i hoped for this app would work was my samsung and vizio smart tv's don't offer this app. i found a old tablet i had forgotten i had. i loaded lifetime and works perfect. i guess what it boils down to, it you are after apps on the playstore, get a non amazon tablet. it is just easier to use, apps should work and you don't have to fool around trying to adapt playstore. if playstore isn't critical, then i'm sure this a a great little table.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
simple tablet for beginners. has everything you neef.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this is my 2nd fire and i was so sad when it crashed. love my new one but giving 4 stars bc the need to update the charger at the bottom. it sticks and you can easily break the inside i wish they would change that	AA Batteries (4-pack)
not much need for this thing, good price, but makes one wonder if they were on sale because they really don't do much and it would make a good gift for a youngster just getting started with a tablet. not impressed at all.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

it is tough to use these tablets if you are use to apple products. internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the amazon programs it is running. everytime my kids play a game, the wireless connection shuts down due to running out of memory. i would not recommend these tablets for anything more that an ebook reader.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a fully functional tablet for under 1000. yes it is slow, yes it works. for my child it is fine. if you are looking for something to be fast, slick, improve your productivity you will need to spend more money.	Wired Headphones

it's ok for the price and what u can do on it i would buy again	Flatscreen TV
if you are all in on amazon, this is the tablet for you. if you don't care about all the bells and whistles, and don't need the latest and greatest tech its a great tablet. we purchased one for my dad 60 and he enjoys it for his web surfing and facebooking. the screen could be bigger, but for the 30 bucks we paid for it, its hard to complain.	27in FHD Monitor
i bought 5 of these for the kids for christmas easy to set up work perfectly	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to set up and use. great tablet for a nontechy!	Google Phone
this is a good product for books only. the apps and other things are not like an ipad. very clunky, slow.however, the kindle is better than an ipad for book reading. it is lighter, the interface with amazon is seamless and you can say download a sample of 40 pages for free before deciding to buy it, which is a huge plus !	34in Ultrawide Monitor
good tablet but it does not include google play like i was told it does by an associate in your store	Flatscreen TV
i bought three of these for my kids ages 7 to 14 and it works great for what they use them for. my only wish is that it came with google play store but we were able to install that separately and works well.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i really like the tablet. it was easy to set up everything on it. the only complaint is that it is a bit slow. i love that i can add storage to it when needed.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

scratches easily but otherwise good. cases can also be hard to find.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the price of this tablet is excellent and the specifications ar very well	Bose SoundSport Headphones
love it working good no lag or anything best gift i have so far	USB-C Charging Cable
the fire tablet has an android operating system but is not like using an android phone. amazon's software makes the tablet more cumbersome to use and the tablet will often freeze. also, you cannot download apps from google play you have to get them from the amazon app store. there are several apps from amazon that you cannot remove even if you do not use them. would not recommend without having amazon support.	iPhone
it's a great tablet for every day needs. great for games, internet access and reading kindle books.	USB-C Charging Cable
i would recommend the kindle fire as a great option for anyone who loves to read book after book. well worth the price. not so thrilled that a 2 year warranty was half the price of the item i purchased but that has nothing to do with the quality of the device.	27in FHD Monitor
i bought this tablet for my senior citizen mother and it is easy for her to use.	27in FHD Monitor

this is my 3rd kindle, and we are very pleased with the ease of use and features amazon has to offer. i suggested my brother get one for his kids and he too is happy. he actually uses it as much or more than his kids do. if you are looking to buy one, i suggest buying a case to help protect it from any bumps or bruises. i lost my 1st gen kindle because it was dropped without a case.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it is inexpensive tablet. the sound is not great too quiet.it is not the best but it is good price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i gave this fire 7 tablet to a good friend for christmas. all she had was a smart phone before and it is pretty small. she just loved the ease of setting it up and uses it all the time now. so much easier to navigate than her phone. now she can lad books and read for a lot cheaper than buying them in the stores. she said she couldn't have received a better gift.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bought this tablet as a gift for my grandfather for christmas and he loves it! very user friendly! it's also lightweight and easy to travel with.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bought this tablet for a family member who isn't very techsavvy. wasn't terribly pleased to see how overflowing the os is with amazon ads and services, but i suppose that's how they keep the costs so low on an extremely affordable tablet. look up how to download the google play store on this tablet to get even more usage out of it. with that addition, it works great, and they love it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought for son for christmas very easy to use and durable	Wired Headphones
wanted a cheap tablet to read books and comics. i found the lack of apps to be disappointing. it seems the tabelt is designed to make one buy books from amazon or to buy apps.	Lightning Charging Cable

i bought this one for myself. it works fine. it is fantastic.	Lightning Charging Cable
as an owner of an ipad, i hesitated to consider the amazon fire tablet as a supplemental device but my purchase of a network of amazon echo dots and the voice cast capability with the fire tablet was almost irresistable. so i bought one as a gift for my friend along with an amazon echo dot to get her opinion of its value. my friend just raves about the fire tablet especially the smaller, lightweight aspects of it. i know i would feel better toting around a small fire tablet that costs only 40 instead of a 500 ipad so it looks like the next fire tablet will be for me!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
now i know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price ie. the price it costs them to make it. they do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. other tablets may have better specs but i bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. and it does its job very well. picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing i love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds. the expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the google or samsung stores are free to download here. they have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. this also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. they have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. this device can ""mirror"" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. this is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what i can tell it is not optional. my old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current more visually pleasing os. it did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. it may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you. overall i like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you're getting.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great beginners tablet, not too small but not that big either	Lightning Charging Cable
simple tablet with all the basics. worth it for the price!	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a great all around tablet. this tablet is currently being used by my daughter and she loves it. it's a good size and the picture quality is good enough to watch cartoons and a few youtube videos on. the best part is that it has a memory slot so you can save videos on it for travel.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this for my toddler to keep her busy on road trips or at appointments and she wasn't too fond of it. it's kinda slow and limited to what you can do. one feature i did like is that you can set a profile for kids and they'll only be able to use apps that you designate for them to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
my kids get a lot of use out of their tablets. however, i wish the battery life was better.	27in FHD Monitor

i bought these for a road trip for my teen daughters. the ability to download amazon prime content for viewing offline was the hook for me. video quality is adjustable with the download and looks great on this screen. battery life is adequate and a nonissue with so many charging possibilities in cars these days. all apps that i have wanted have been available for it too.

i was skeptical of such a low price point tablet. my children broke a more expensive tablet that i owned and i needed a replacement. i absolutely love it.	Apple Airpods Headphones

the fire tablet is great, especially for the price! and if you are an amazon prime member, it's even better. you can read books for free using amazon's lending library and watch prime videos for free too. you can even get google play store and download apps just google it on the fire. make sure you get a micro sd card right away, because the 8gb internal storage fills up very quickly.

love everything about the unit except that it gets hot when used for 10 to 15 minutes. hope it doesn't burn or explode.	Google Phone
purchased for my kids but it was hard to navigate and ended up with purchasing an ipad	USB-C Charging Cable
overall, this is a far cry from the more popular ipad, and is nowhere near as intuitive or easy to use, but as a less expensive option for my children to learn on it is the perfect fit. the price point is perfect for first time tablet users, though you will surely need to invest in a memory card to expand the storage capacity.

when i bought this product i never expected it to be anything like this. it has got decent screen quality and response time. definitely worth the price. requires amazon account to install apps, read books etc.	Vareebadd Phone

bought this for my younger sister. she's 9 and uses it to stream netflix and play games. she tells me it's fantastic	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this is definitely not an ipad or a high end tablet. nevertheless, for the discounted price that i paid on it so, less than 50, it is well worth getting. i wanted something bigger while waiting for the next ipad air to come out, and this fits the bill for paying little and getting a basic low end tablet. it is geared towards amazon media consumption, ad it does that decently even with a screen resolution less than hd. if the sale comes back again where it is 15 off, i would not hesitate to recommend it again.	USB-C Charging Cable
gave this to my mom and dad and they love it! perfect!	Google Phone
my parents loved receiving this for christmas! old people friendly.	Wired Headphones

it's exactly what i was looking for. my sister was very happy with it and it meets her needs.	USB-C Charging Cable
very fast and kid friendly for my young son gifts.	ThinkPad Laptop
great price! got it for my kid for christmas. he loves it! he plays games on it and streams netflix with ease!	USB-C Charging Cable
i have an older kindle this has so many more options. it has a camera more apps.	ThinkPad Laptop
i was looking for a kindle fire because i have had other android tablets in the past and most times the kindle app makes them crash or takes up too much space on the tablet. i like it for reading but it isn't as great for other things and you are not allowed to have the google play store on it because that competes with the amazon app store. however, not all apps are available on the amazon app store so this was an immediate drawback for me. i will keep this and use it but in the future i will not buy kindle tablets again.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a great tablet for the money. i got it on black friday and am so glad i did get a few of them for the entire family. the biggest thing that sold me on this is that i am able to use parental controls and not worry about what my little kids are watching, reading, or playing. go buy it for the family, you won't regret it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my wife for xmas. also bought 3 more for each of my kids. great interface, easy to use. suggest buying a memory card as well for storage of all the apps.	27in FHD Monitor
great small tablet with great value!must get one asap. you can't beat this price!	Lightning Charging Cable
she has no idea that this item has limitations and was thrilled to receive a tablet with a camera. she seems to be entrenched in it 247 so it must be working.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great tablet, especially for the price. i didn't know exactly what i would use this for when first purchased, but have found many cool uses.	20in Monitor
the tablet works good for my son with the games he use	Google Phone
i brought this for my nephew6. he loves it does everything that the high dollar tablets do but at a fraction of the the cost. a very good buy!	Lightning Charging Cable
i got this on black friday for 35. even at the regular price of 50, it's a steal. it is a basic tablet that will download apps and go on the internet. while the internet browser isn't that great, it is comparable to a phone system, which costs a lot more.	Vareebadd Phone
would recommend it 100. easy to use great for kids	Bose SoundSport Headphones
first time i have ever used a kindle fire and i wasn't disappointed. it is very good tablet. the only downside is that there aren't that many apps like the google store has.	Lightning Charging Cable
every time it was turned on and every time i went to the internet i had advertisement. if i'm going to pay money for something i certainly don't want advertisement along with it. if it were free okay fine advertise to me.the advertisement could not be shut off. i returned it.	Flatscreen TV
this tablet performs very well. it is great for someone that does not need a sophisticated tablet. great value for the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this for my husband to play his games onclash of clans. the bb salesperson assured me he would be able to use it for that. got it home, turns out you can only usegets apps from the amazon store which does not include games like clash of clans. it was already opened and set up so i gave it to my 6 yr old. he plays a few games on it and watches some movies, but would much rather play with the ipad.	iPhone
easy to operate. easy to download books. size is great for carrying in a purse. color is really good. very happy with this product.	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased 3 of these, one for each of my children.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought 2 fire tablets so my boys would not be starng at their iphones for games. they were thrilled!	USB-C Charging Cable
this amazon fire tablet is a nice little tablet. picture is sufficient for the price. audio output is on back so if it's in a case, the sound is muted, but otherwise nice tablet for the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this for a 3 year old great for kids for games and movies	Wired Headphones
we bought two of these for our kids and they both love them! easy to set up and operate. they are a welcome improvement over them using their phones for all the apps and games they enjoy.	Lightning Charging Cable
good working tablet. just the right size and glad that i am able to add a memory card. good apps available for this tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
daughter loves it and great customer service! educational and fun!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i was looking for a basic tablet for normal use games and music and this tablet answered my need and to top it up fit my budget as well. i bought this during the thanksgiving season this year and is worth the price i shelled out. bestbuy as usual shipped it in time and free shipping was just an icing on the cake . would recommend this to anyone.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
order two and love them. great gifts for anybody get cases for them	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is exacting what it is, an inexpensive, decent tablet. i got it for grandchildren to use for game apps and books from amazon.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought the fire for my father for christmas. the is his first tablet and i was afraid he would not use it. he has not put it down and it could not be more user friendly! i would recommend to anyone looking for a low cost tablet!	Lightning Charging Cable
it really is helpful to have this tablet around. it's really good for its price but the camera isn't so good but it still is a great deal.	Lightning Charging Cable
very convenient item to use. easy to read ebooks and came with one month of amazon prime.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my 9 year old and it is perfect for reading books and playing games. my only disappointment is with kindle because if i put him as i child under my account he has access to my books, which i do not want to happen. i had to create an account just for him.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
not as good as the hdx but does well for 50. also much slower than hdx. screen is more pixelated than anticipated. would probably spend more next time and get a quicker unit.	Lightning Charging Cable
nice device not bad on sale. you get what you pay for.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
very good item. works well for child. easy to use.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this was a great product foe the money. was able to download games for kids with no problems. easy to access parental controls for myself.love it	Wired Headphones

it is good tablet if you do not high expectations of performance, good for traveling by car and use to see maps or give to kids	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought for my k classroom! great price for student use!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i hesitated initially when purchasing this tablet, mostly because i have never had a tablet or ereader and wasn't sure i could figure out how to use it. even though this table comes with virtually no instructions, there is a lot of information online and it is very intuitive, even for a total novice. now, just about a month since my purchase, i am loving this tablet so much and am so happy i purchased it. the price break made it an even sweeter purchase.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this isn't a high performance tablet but i didn't expect it to be for the price. it's perfect for playing app games, reading, and web browsing. the biggest downfall is the limitations on customizing the home screens.	Lightning Charging Cable
this was a replacement for a previous fire. my wife loves it and the fire does what she needs	USB-C Charging Cable
love this kindle fire. awesome product for an incredible price.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my granddaughter has the kids version so i purchased this one for an older nephew and he lives this kindle.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

got it for my 2 year old nephew. he is now completing puzzles and playing educational games on it!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
for the price this was a great tablet for my kids. they love it!	USB-C Charging Cable
hard to beat, especially during black friday at 35. meets the needs.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a good tablet for the price, however, it runs slow and the touch screen response is not the best. this isn't the right tablet if you're looking for a high speed, high performance tablet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this as a requirement for my sons class. it was easy to set up, and he uses it with no problem at all. he just uses it for research in class, so i didn't want to spend a lot moneyor give him my tablet, but i'm very pleased with all he's able to do on it. the price just seals the deal i'm very pleased overall and would repurchase the tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i like what you get for the price. but it is a little tricky for my kids to figure out so i do have to help them a lot.	Lightning Charging Cable
as good if not better than many other more expensive tablets	Google Phone
this table works okay but slow. warning, this device is ad subsidized for the price, meaning you have to see ads.	Flatscreen TV
easy to use economical and portable.i intially bought just for reading but it has been useful in apps facebook etc.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
realy good tablet for a great price can't go wrong	Google Phone
nothing flashy. if you want something simple that you can just grab and go, use with babiestoddlers, throw around etc then this tablet is great. if you want something a little more robust save up for one of the more expensive models.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this tablet for my little cousin and it fitted him perfectly. after 2 or 3 years, i might get him a bigger one.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i tried a few samsung tables they were junk and i paid 4 times the price for those. this out preformed them 10 fold and was 14 of the cost. still not quite an ipad but for the price there is probably nothing better. free time for the kids is a great feature.	Wired Headphones
my 8 year old is required to read for 20 minutes a day for school. something about reading on an electronic device excites and he is willing to read without a fight. great purchase for us.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my 3 year old, so she would have another option for watching her shows besides my ipad. needless to say, she was too frustrated with the slowness to load the netflix app, and it would only get internet if you were in the same room as the modem. you really do get what you pay for. if you buy this, don't count on getting online very seamlessly. the internet browser is really slow to use, but you can get around this by downloading google play store to access the firefox app, which is not offered on the amazon app store. check youtube for instructions.	Wired Headphones
i bought 3 of these for my kids. the parental controls are good, lacking in some areas but overall what i was looking for. a way to limit what they can do and i control what is on the tablet not them. and i can see their web history etc.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this tablet for my grandson and he loves it.	20in Monitor
i bought this for my 7 yr old daughter and she loves it! this is a great and inexpensive item for a young child.	Wired Headphones
my kids are loving their kindles and they are easy for them and for me to manage	Apple Airpods Headphones
we bought wowwee mip robots for our grandsons, 8 and 11 years old. they don't have ipad or iphone in their home. so thoroughly researched what else would work for installing the app. talked with best buy salesperson, who said the app could be loaded via the app store it can't.kindle fire 2015 is included on the wowwee ""compatibility"" list. so we bought them each a brand new kindle in order to use the app. they had kindles from earlier years, but these wouldn't support the bluetooth functionality needed for the robots.absolute fail. we tried every possible configuration adult vs child amazon accounts bluetooth on first or off first mip on first or off first etc. it never worked at all not even once.also tried full factory reset on each device, loading the app via a google play account, rather than amazon kindle account. google play wouldn't load the app said it wasn't compatible with this kindle device.opened a ticket on wowwee. the response was that they've had the same experience the bluetooth on this kindle fails and so the app doesn't work with the wowwee robots. they admit it fails, yet it's still on their approved list.so this was an absolute waste of money, tho at least the boys can play some free games we loaded for them.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased this table for my son to check email, watch movies and play games. he loves it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
nice tablet for beginner or casual user. basic functions.	iPhone
you can't beat a tablet at this price! i bought it mostly for reading books on the go on the kindle app, but i've also been using it for so much more. i would recommend to anyone looking to buy an extra device at a low price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great item to use with kids. i like adding memory as needed. i love the kindle fire aspects.some items can be read by text to speech.i think the kids will like the camera, their old kindle fires did not have this.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this is a great light weight android tablet. it works well for most things that i wanted to use it for. i wanted to see if it would work for board packets but decided that the form factor is too small. as a reader and light weight table it works great. at this price it is a great buy.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it's the best tablet 50 can buy. touch screen is better then my first gen nexus 7.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
love this tablet bought 4 for my kids and myself and play games and read on these!	Wired Headphones
this tablet has been perfect for my son. i actually bought 3 and my kids love it. the amazon app store has tons of free games for kids panda, toca, etc. my kids are 4, 5 and 10. in my opinion best cheap tablet for a family on the go. screen is good for kids, seen no lag in performance also. not sure about camera they never use it.

amazon had the item sold out so i went to best buy to purchase and they had plenty in stock, in store, which was great.	iPhone
obviously talking about a budget tablet here so you obviously get what you pay for as always but this is a really decent tablet for 35 bucks what i paid on black friday. does all your basic 'tabby' things and is very mobile. great for those kids who feel the need for a tablet but you dont wanna break the bank haha.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
you get what you pay for, great little device for very cheap. this would have been a high end tablet a few years ago. to get one for sub 100 and not have it be a p.o.s. tablet from some no name branch is amazing. i use it as an ereader, for games, for second screen when watching movies or playing xbox, etc. great battery, included ads are unobtrusive, really only notice them when they appear on unlock screen or when it makes book recommendations. none of which i mind to save fifteen bucks on the unit. highly recommend. if you lose it or it breaks you barely spent anything on it and just get another one. the microsd support is really nice too	AA Batteries (4-pack)
have purchased 45 tablets in my life, always samsung or apple, my first experience with an amazon tablet, very happy with my purchase	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet was good enough for reading, check email and watch some movies on internet. it doesn't has a lot of option for free app as samsung or apple devices.	Apple Airpods Headphones
definitely not the largest or mostpowerful tablet you can find, but it made an excellent gift for my techfearing mom! facebook, email, reading, web browsing and maybe some netflix that's the limit of what she does online and this tablet fits the bill.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

amazon's know for there tablets. mine works great, good wifi and memory. i love the quadcore processor, great screen, crisp and clear.comfortable and easy to use. 1010	34in Ultrawide Monitor
picked this up for a spare tablet, and at 49 it was a no brainer. videos, games, books, music work great. lots of capabilities. screen looks great and it does feel a lot sturdier as it was a more expensive tablet. if you can't find an app, you can install google play store have to search for it online for instructions. i did return this tablet as we specifically bought this to be use while on the treadmill, and you can't access bravo or e! tv. they only make apps for ios ipadipodiphone other than that.its not a problem with amazon or their tablet, i blame it on bravo.excellent tablet otherwise. i will definitely buy it again in the future. just don't need it at this moment.	Lightning Charging Cable
loooovvvvveeee it!	USB-C Charging Cable
love the idea that this tablet is expandable to 128gb. the ipad mini 2 that i also have does not compare even close to this tablet, as it is not expandable beyond its 16gb. overall, just an outstanding tablet.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i bought 2 of these and they were both christmas gifts 1 for my daughter and 1 for her daughter. the price was great ! now, how do i let you know who the owners are and how they can set them up in their names?	Bose SoundSport Headphones
overall for the price you can't really complain, yes it has directed advertisements on the start screen when you turn it on but again, 50 for a tablet isn't that bad and the ads can be removed by subscribing to amazon prime which offers features in itself too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent just 50 , and has all the features and a vast collection of books	Apple Airpods Headphones
i actually ended up returning this item because i got frustrated with the adds. if it wasn't for that i probably would have given it 5 stars.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
easy to use for daily usage . small and can be hold using one hand . very good option for kid .	Wired Headphones
bought the original kindle fire, and was impressed with the latest updated version. better software, camera, and more apps make this all the more worth the small price. i guess that amazon takes a loss on the production of this unit to gain your interest in buying their merchandise and using their services. in any case, it works, and i would recommend this to anyone interested in an inexpensive internet access device.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought for kids to play games on, good for what they need it.	Wired Headphones

would buy again good resolution. wish the screen was bigger	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this to replace my samsung galaxy tab that was about 3 years old and seemed to be running slow and was a bit heavy for a 7inch tablet. this is much lighter and since i will probably use it mostly to read books and play games like candy crush it is fast and easy to use. very happy with it so far.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use. good first tablet. would highly recommend.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
my google nexus suddenly died with 5 blinks of death so i got this for temporary tablet. nice to have micro sd slot. can't find some of my needed apps yet like my bank. maybe it's me.it has single speaker but if i want nice sound i'll use headphones.maybe a touch dimmer than the nexus.it fits my old bluetooth keyboard so i'm good.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
the sales rep told me this kindle fire tablet is easy to set up. just follow the directions. three hours later a trip back to the store, a member of the geek squad finally got my e mail to work. he could not tell me why it was a problem. also the camera quality is very poor. if you use it to check your e mails and browse the web, its fine. other than that. oh well.

i bought this tablet for my mom and she loves it! very easy to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
perfect timing since this is going to replace the original kindle that was bought for my daughter. definitely can't complain about the price	Flatscreen TV
could not beat the price and the kindle fire is a nice tablet to have for reading, playing games, letting grandkids play on.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
first, let me say, that i only took one star away, because even after getting i touch installed, my little girl can turn the unit off or mess with whatever is playing by pushing buttons. not sure if it would have been worth it to pay the extra fifty for the kids edition. aside from that one single item, this has been an excellent purchase.	27in FHD Monitor
great for a good read or binge watching in your bedroom. slim size tablet so it fits perfectly in your palm	Lightning Charging Cable

great price on a nice little tablet , easy to use !	Bose SoundSport Headphones
my daughter loves this tablet. it's not as big and flashy as some but it has all the bells and whistles needed.	Wired Headphones
the tablet is great for only 50 but certainly not the most touch responsive. it feels a little slow to me. it also irked me that you have to pay extra to remove the ads from the lock screen.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
would recommend for anyone great value big screen great features	Apple Airpods Headphones
just getting this kindle figured out. so far i like what i see.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my first tablet purchase is perfect for my needs. very easy to operate.	Lightning Charging Cable
the screen is mediocre. the processor is good, very little storage. and you have to deal with ads, every time you turn on the screen. you can pay to have them removed. for that price you can get a better screen, more storage and open ecocistem. that is not tied only to amazon	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought two of these for the kids so they would not fight and could each have their own. they love them so far. i like that i can add an sd card for extra storage.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great black friday deal. love the tablets. recommended	Wired Headphones
using the tablet on a daily basiseasy to use especially for reading msgs and news items.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this to replace my nook reader, 50 for a fire vs 140 for a new nook was a no brainer. i had to use calibre to convert some epub books to mobile format on the fire, but that was easy. the ability to use wifi to check email, surf the web, it's miles ahead of the black and white nook.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a awsome tablet and a great value love it!	27in FHD Monitor
this tablet offers amazing value for the price. it is not hd but still offers good resolution. reminds me of the graphics on the first ipad or ipad mini 1. performance is right up there with the more expensive models. with the ability to add more storage with an sd card, and amazon customer service, you really can't go wrong with this one.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a really good tablat at a good price. my sister bought one naby tablet from another store at 200 and is not even working she has troble to charge the naby tablet for that reason i gave her the amazon tablet is not expensive and also has good feautures.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i ordered two for my grandchildren for christmas and decided to get one for me on the black friday deal because i couldn't beat the price. i've been using it for about 1 week and so far i am really liking it and my grandkids will love it. they only issue i've had is the 3rd day i couldn't get it to charge so had to do a hard restart but now the charger cord that came with it no longer works but its too short anyway so i use a micro usb cord i had. i've read that this is an issue with these but who doesn't have an extra micro usb cord laying around.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the tablet is very durable, and it also contains sufficient applications. good quality.	Wired Headphones
i brought this tablet for my 5 year old nephew. for 50.00 he can stay off mine and enjoy netflix and you tube. plus it has parental control. greatest gift ever!	Macbook Pro Laptop
this is great for a first time tablet owner lots of features	AA Batteries (4-pack)
got this tablet for my daughter and she loved it again great tablet.	Wired Headphones
decent product. not so much if you're used to android software. you can't get your photos saved in google. more than half of my music collection vanished once the memory card was inserted. basicly have to hack the thing to get any apps outside of amazon and then reliability is poor. exchanged it for am android tablet	Apple Airpods Headphones
would be better if you could use the google play store, still haven t figured out how to download yet	Bose SoundSport Headphones
my wife's laptop bit the dust and i needed a lowcost solution so she could read her email and surf the net. this device does the job. i was impressed with the quality for 50. i have no complaints. cheap, easy to use and keeps the wife happy. good deal!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
before you conclude it does not have enough, look at what it can do and read the specs.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this for my five year sister. it's easy to use she loves it. she had a nabi before but the charger port wasn't suited for a young child it was easy to break. this tablet is ten times better all around.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought for a christmas present for family member, great value.	USB-C Charging Cable
i've avoided an ereader as my tablet served well. when amazon released this new kindle fire for 50, i thought, why not? i'm traveling a lot and it's nice and compact.whoa! it also doubles as a tablet, as far as being able to access internet, email, other things the amazon app i can't remember the name, but it's preinstalled has hundreds of freeyes, freeapps.i'm delighted to the point i've now purchased two more as gifts. i did add an sd card to increase storage space, but that was minor. great product excellent buy!	Flatscreen TV
i have two apple ipads that my students and i use in my third grade classroom. i've wanted one for home use but didn't want the expense. this amazon fire tablet does just about as much as my school apple i pads but at less than a quarter of the cost. the amazon fire tablets are smaller but easy to use and amazingly fast loading! wish i had one for each student!	20in Monitor
we're really enjoying it. the price was right. great 4 a beginner	AA Batteries (4-pack)
can't really tell you much as i gave it as a gift but it has been well received.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought three of these tablets. they are the best tablets around. they are very fast and durable as well. they are simple to use both of my children use them. i haven't had any issues with this product.	Wired Headphones
it was on sale. worth it for a first time tablet buyer for something inexpensive	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
pretty good tablet for the cost, i would highly recommend!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
a great tablet for the price, i love now that the amazon fire tablet has a micro sd slot. lightweight, connect to net easy,	USB-C Charging Cable
for the money this tablet can't be beat. great for kids or adults who aren't looking for a powerful tablet.	Google Phone

AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love this. it is great. one of the best things i ever bought. it can do so much.	Apple Airpods Headphones
you cannot beat the price on this tablet, but there is no bluetooth. also, it really hits you hard with advertising and trying to get you to do everything through amazon. we bought it to use in the kitchen with our digital cookbooks.	Lightning Charging Cable
i read mixed reviews on these tablets and nearly talked myself out of buying one, but then on black friday the price hit 35 bucks temporarily, so i bought it.i am really happy that i did.while it's no where near that of the apple devices in overall image quality, it puts out a pretty nice screen view with plenty of color and brightness.i was able to download all the main social media apps, several streaming content apps, and plenty of games to mess around with all for free. so far only 1 app has ""crashed"" on me resulting in a restart.the size is perfect, almost fits in a man's jeans back pocket without a case, but large enough to enjoy looking at for extended periods.battery seems to hold up well, and the buttons are working as they should, with quick transitions and processing.i added a 64gb sd card to store things later, but i never planned on using it for much more than an around the house browsing or streaming device.the camera works well.the sound is decent.they make cases just like that of the apple tablets for as little as 8 bucks.bottom line, it's not the best tablet, but it is a good one for someone who's never used one or just wants one for general purpose use. i would trust a device from amazon a lot quicker then some of these cheaper tablets.we bought 4 more to give away at christmas we liked ours so much.	Lightning Charging Cable
great and easy setup. easy to use for people that don't have much tech experience	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
got this for a present for someone, and they love it. they really wanted an e reader not a tablet and that's why he loves it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
awesome little tablet. it isn't the fastest, but it gets the job done. bought one for my father and one for myself. he uses it to watch diy videos on youtube and online browsing. i do the same and also listen to my spotify playlists. it's pretty cheap too!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
we love this tablet and the price. awesome deal. it was so good we going back to get two more. it's amazing . can't say no more except get you one	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this tablet to connect to my hdtv. after not being able to get it to connect, i called amazon customer care who informed me that this model doesn't connect to the tv, but the previous model 4th generation does and that i should purchase the amazon fire stick. why the newer model does less.who knows. if you want to watch movies just on the tablet then it's a great buy, but didn't work for my purposes.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
not top of the line but don't let the price fool you. if you don't already have a tablet and not looking to spend a lot this is perfect. plenty of free apps and games. you get the most for your dollar on this product, makes a great gift for friends and family.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i love it , this was a great investment for my family	Wired Headphones
my mother has the larger amazon tablet, which prompted me to purchase this version. the tablet screen seemed smaller than a standard 7' tablet, so i returned it.	iPhone
i bought this item for my kid for 35 and enjoying lot. compared to other tabs this is a great bargain.pros its easy to use , battery is excellent works for long, even while games are being played.strong body and very good touch sensitive.cons screen resolution looks little grayish , not bright enough. which probably is good for kid eyes while playing longer.	Wired Headphones
small tablet, i have an ipad but this item is great to take along fits in your purse and is very durable. i have purchased 3 other for family.	Apple Airpods Headphones
so beautiful and system is very good and the app is good too.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
its worth to buy this table for the price. elegant design and response. feel better than samsung tab	AA Batteries (4-pack)
got for a 4 year old solely for games has enough memory for kid apps	USB-C Charging Cable
was a nice deal for 50 bucks can't beat that and its fast and works great	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet does what it supposed to do, however, if you have one of the newer smart phones with a large screen there just isn't enough difference in the screen size to justify a second piece of equipment.	27in FHD Monitor
great kindle for the price nice picture for a 7 inch screen	Macbook Pro Laptop
i bought my wife one, she bought me one a few weeks later and now i'm going to buy my mamma one. great on the go, take to work and business trip device. my little girl loves learning on the kids abc and coloring app!	27in FHD Monitor
it is an amazing product for beggnners, high quality materials amd fast processor	ThinkPad Laptop
bucks and it's still a good tablet . i have issues with it cause i've always used the ipad so it's a completely different experience .i just wanted something to watch movies while i rode the train and this is perfect . the biggest flaw is the ads everytime you turn it on but makes up with the capability of adding storage . look 50 bucks for a good tablet is cheaper than a night out with friends	iPhone
i purchased this tablet for my mother for the camera, reading books, and emailing. awesome price and value!	Wired Headphones
the unit seems to have a sturdy build and it loads and unloads very quickly	Lightning Charging Cable
i thought 49 for a kindle tablet was a fantastic price until the black friday deal of 35. i did add a 32gb memory card. kindle freetime is great. my 6 year old loves the tablet. works great with many kid friendly apps. i also put a kid proof cover.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had an old kindle, and its battery was beginning to fail. the kindle fire 7 replaces it, with much more functionality. it does, however, require charging more often.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
restricts use of some web pages including barnes and nobles where i have a library useless to read the books in my barnes library	Bose SoundSport Headphones
for the little price i paid this was a good buy for the kids. i prefer the amazon tablets for my kids so they can be more involved with reading.	USB-C Charging Cable
great to read books and it do almost everything a table will do	Wired Headphones
don't expect top of the line performance from this 50 dollar unit but it has really nice picture ok sound and good battery life. shortcomings would be small memory causing laggy performance at times unless you keep your storage amount low on the built in memory.	Wired Headphones
i bought about 5 tablets before. this is the best tablets i ever bought.	Vareebadd Phone
only reason i was not able to rate this five of five is that the app 3m cloud library is not yet compatible so getting books from the library requires an older app which does not work as well.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
a really nice tablet for a first time owner. works great and has a decent sized screen	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i had a tablet that was stolen and i was happy to replace it with this one it is just as nice and easy to use!	iPhone
works great with a prime account. get 1 free book per month. only problem is if you have 2 tablets you both have to share the same book. works great with my local library.remember those?	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
for me it is too small. i would prefer it to be 8"".	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i originally bought this tablet for my granddaughters birthday gift. when i saw how easy it was for her to access her homework and other reading materials she needed for school i was so impressed i bought 5 more for each one of my grand kids for christmas i would recommend this tablet to family friends.

my old kindle fire got pushed into the water by my cat, so i bought a new one. it's ok, but nothing to write home about. kinda of slow and the size is a little awkward.too narrow. it'll do, and the price is right, but if you can afford more, buy a better tablet.	Wired Headphones
i have been wanting to get a kindle for my children and happened to see this at best buy. couldn't pass up a fantastic kindle at a great price.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this tablet is excellent. hard to imagine all these features can be in this unit for under 50.00.it is a must buy, especially if you have children who like to use your tablet. perhaps buy them one of their own.for us it is one of a few tablets we own, but it is one we are glad to have.

for 50 bucks, it's a nice starter tablet. wish it had bluetooth but can't really complain at this price	Apple Airpods Headphones
it does the job for me. its small and portable. keep it in air plane mode with the wifi for longer battery life.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the tablet works only when it wants too. i have to restart it all the time for it to work properly. only have 2 weeks with it and the youtube app sucks it doesn't work properly	Lightning Charging Cable
so what they have adds. my wife got it for 50 and i know on black friday it was 35. where else are you going to find a color screen for that price. it works well and couldn't be happier.	USB-C Charging Cable
i gave this to my 3 yr old to play games and watch movies. my tv's have been reclaimed!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
for an inexpensive tablet it works great. does the basics very well.	Lightning Charging Cable

got it for my son to replace his old one and for the kids free time app good so far	Google Phone
it's a very good one for my children to play with so	USB-C Charging Cable
sure. it's not an ipad, but it's only 50 bucks! amazon is taking a loss on these in order to sell you their content. there are a few restrictions, like an advertisement on the lock screen and only access to amazon's app store. these are small prices to pay for such a wonderfully performing tablet. also, amazon underground gives you access to a ton of paid apps for free. if this is your first tablet purchase, it is definitely a winner. for those not new to the tablet world, it is definitely worth having just to carry around when you need it. you won't feel so bad if someone steals it or you losebreak it as opposed to an ipad. just buy it already!

i had always wanted a fire tablet and when this deal came along i couldn't pass it up! great tablet and well worth the price! lots of apps to choose from, easy to set up and use! i highly recommend this tablet for anyone!	ThinkPad Laptop
seems to be relatively user friendly but as a new tablet owner, i would have appreciated having some basic instructions come with it rather than have to learn everything by trial and error. i'm sure i still do not understand many of the capabilities this tablet has to offer.	Flatscreen TV
i brought 3 for my boys and they love it. my three year old watch mickey mouse, my 9 year ol surf the web for homework and my 15 year old use it for you tube and music even live chat with his friends.	Lightning Charging Cable
this tablet does everything the ipad mini can do except that it is cheaper than the ipad.	LG Washing Machine
for the price, it's hard to beat. don't go into this thinking it is like any other android tab. in many ways it is, and the ability to sideload apps helps. but this is primarily a vehicle to get you into the amazon ecosystem. not necessarily bad, but those expecting full access to google will be disappointed.what it is good forweb surfingnewsreaderaudio playernetflix, hulu, etcwhat's not so greatno gps, location enabled but not true gpsscreen resolution, angles and clarity are good but given the price, it can be forgiven	USB-C Charging Cable

for the price, it's a decent tablet. they way they get the price down is to psuh ads to your device. you can pay 15 to get the ads removed. overall it's a good tablet.	Macbook Pro Laptop

i bought this for my girlfriendand she loves it. the only thing she doesn't like is that some games on the app market that is on her phone doesn't appear on her tablet	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the fire tablet does everything i need it to do. bought this as a gift for my 10 year old and he couldn't be happier. he can download all his games and apps, i like the parental controls on it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i was originally just looking for a cheap but reliable tablet, on a postbirthday afternoon, when i learned amazon was selling a low budget version of the current kindle generation.while my opinion is slightly biased due to some personal modifications, i can say this is an excellent purchase if you're looking for a portable browser and book reader. a fairly decent and accurate battery. sound is low in volume but reliable. expandable memory works for applications, so dozens of apps can be added quickly. while i can personally say it's extremely durable compared to ios devices. a small fall against smooth stone does not cost anything but extremely fine scratches only visible in sunlight.however, by default, you're extremely restricted by the amazon marketplace, which is nowhere near as updated and expansive as google play. if this could access both stores, i'd give it a 5 out of 5.	27in FHD Monitor
if you are a amazon prime member you will love this tablet. even without prime membership its still a nice tablet.	Google Phone
bought this for my brother who is a dino when it comes to technology, it's easy to use and a great size ,he loved it!	Wired Headphones
great picture quality and very easy to operate. got it for the granddaughter.	Flatscreen TV
i like this tablet for it's size, it's easy to hold on to when reading. i can put this in my bag when travelling and it doesn't weigh much.i also love the fact that i can expand the memory, whereas the other one i have 8.9 inch doesn't have that capability.the camera works great.the only problem i have is trying to turn it off it doesn't always want to turn off.other than that i love this tablet.	iPhone
my 7 year old loves the tablet. it is very durable.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this tablet the kindle fire7 for my woman and she absolutely loves it, works flawless for all her needs,very well made, does not come across as a cheap tablet a absolute must buy for 49.99! best 50 tablet on the market hands down better than some i spent much more money on and in fact should i need one myself currently have a insignia flex8 16gb i will buy one for me. great tablet for kids as well for 50 and the reliability great buy!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
what made this even better was the black friday prices on the kindle fires. at 35.00, if they get broken, it's not as big of a deal. i remember buying one of these when they came out and it was a whole lot more than it is now. that's technology for you, i guess. great buy. great product.

a tablet for under 50. what a good deal. thanks amazon.	20in Monitor
i recommend it mostly for reading, but it's ok as a tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought it on thanksgiving night just opened pkg and the screen is crushed. haven't been able to take it back but was told when i called in that they might not have any in stock.	Apple Airpods Headphones
handy size and works well for what it is. would be a 5 if google play store. but it is available	USB-C Charging Cable
cheap tablet for price, for a kid or an older person that might not know how to use it.	USB-C Charging Cable
first off the tablet is 50 so don't go in expecting it to be on par with the latest ipad. for the price you pay though, you get a really good tablet. screen is a little lower than 720p, but you have access to all of the kindle books, amazon prime, the new fire os, which looks alot better than the ""all black"" on the last few kindle fire's. this model is only 8gb but storage is expandable, i have a 64gb micro sd in my tablet. recommended.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this mainly for my grandkids to play. the time limits you can set is great because they don't argue about who's on the most.	Wired Headphones
great and easy to use budget tablet for 35 when i purchased it. get one	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this 7"" 2015 version should have been marketed to children only. it's like a very ""dumbed"" down, cheap version of the better firehd and hdx. screen is not as good, battery life is bad, no mirroring to tv and it's slooowww as can be. if you've never owned another kind of kindle you will probably be accepting of this watered down version. for those that know what a real kindle should be like, you may want to pass on this one. another version should be along soon and since they can't get much worse than this one you'll probably get a better one. i got mine on black friday for a little over 30. total with shopping discounts and i'm still sending it back! that's how disappointed i am with it.	ThinkPad Laptop
overall, this tablet is great for kids and adults. it's not overpriced and you can do a lot with it. including, browsing the web, downloading paid or free apps, downloading books free or paid, listening to music, shopping right through amazon, storing files, and plenty more. i wouldn't trade this tablet for any other.	Product
worth getting, great for the priceand very handy for movies and music	Lightning Charging Cable
was not a fan of this product browsers are extremely slow	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i have an ipad but thought i would buy this black friday to play around with and program to give to my mother to enjoy.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a very good starter tablet for anyone wanting to mess with one without breaking the bank. everything runs and looks great from videos to games to books. only thing that i feel could push people away is the app storeuses amazon's. otherwise this is great.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the tablet was on a great deal for black friday. i purchased it just for reading books and lightly going online. i am not expecting amazing power from something so cheap, i dig it for what it can do and not for what i think it should do.	USB-C Charging Cable
i am happy that i purchased this tablet because it has become very useful when i do my studying and for social media. it is a cute size so it fits in my purse easily . the only reason i do not give it 5 stars is because it doesnt have the ability to add some apps such as chegg, snapchat and among others.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i love this kindle and price is awesome .my three year boy love to play it.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a must buy for anyone. it's sturdy and its a amazon for only fifty dollars. but the camera is not good for photography but its worth fifty dollars overall.	iPhone
i got this on black friday for 35. for the price i wasn't expecting much. let me tell you it exceeded my expectations. i was only wanting this to play music, but i have been checking my email, browsing the web, using bluetooth for music. its amazing. it can go the whole day on one charge. you will defiantly want a sd card for it! it rarely lags and is pretty fast too. only thing i don't like is the ads on lock screen you can pay 15 more to remove them	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this tablet this thanksgiving for 35.tablet is too slow and apps doesn't responds properly, tried doing the updates over wifi to see if that resolves the issue but that didn't work too.commons apps like gmail, facebook, messenger or browser related are dying very frequently and sometimes doesn't even boots up, also, coming from android you will feel that you have landed up in a deserted apps land.a good tablet for kids but adults can't rely on it !	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this item for my daughter and she loves it. easy to use, beautiful picture, and a great price.	Wired Headphones
i bought it for a gift and i love the price. also my nice is enjoying it	Flatscreen TV
i got this for my brother as an early christmas gift. he has never owned a tablet before and not super tech savvy. he really enjoyed it and never put it down over the holiday weekend. it was easy for him to use and adapt to.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i like this device because it keeps my niece and nephew happy while on the road. for the price, it can't be beat. it's not as intuitive as it could be.	27in FHD Monitor
i must say i have always been making jokes about amazon and their devices, but after getting the amazon fire 7, i must admit i have been wrong. this little device is amazing for such a low price. you honestly get a lot for your money, and i can definitely recommend it to people who want a good tablet without spending 100 on one.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this works fine. it's a tablet! it does things well!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great little tablet for the money and does nearly everything you would want to do with a tablet. i plan to use it for travel and leave my expensive ipad air 2 home. i was impressed with the resolution when viewing photos and it works well for reading email and internet surfing. it is also great to have adequate storage by adding a micro card to the unit. probably the major drawback is the camera, which does not take a very good picture when compared to cell phones and other tablets. again, for the money, it's a great value for a small tablet.	20in Monitor
works great for me. good for first time user. good for money as well.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i own the kindle fire hd 6 and love it.this is a christmas gift for a friend. hopefully she will love it. great price	Macbook Pro Laptop
my son just loves his fire tablet. easy for him to setup to his liking. can't beat the price either. at the time of the review it was 34.99. if you have kids, this makes a great gift for them.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
awesome it was great it was a lot of good apps i reccomend it	ThinkPad Laptop
i updated my kindle touch to this. i loved the price. i got it a few months ago for 50, which is still an affordable price for a kindle. i love the bluetooth and text to speech features coupled with the fact that it has an expandable drive. those features along with the price were what i needed. oh did i mention the resolution for watching movies is good. the camera is not the best, but i didn't get this for the camera. matter of fact i got one on black friday as a christmas gift for a friend.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i didn't expect a lot at this price, but i also did not expect both of my tablets to be riddled with deadstuck pixels right out of the box. i have a third arriving in the mail and am just praying that i am at least good for 13. waiting on its arrival before doing the trip for returnreplacement just in case that one needs to go as well. maybe just bad luck, but definitely worth noting for anyone who may also be inconvenienced by having to do a return.everything else seems good though when you can look past the display issues, but may be worth waiting until these defective lots have been disbursed and the issues have been corrected.i am sure if you don't have these display issues that the product deserves more than 2 stars, but if you can see things from my perspective it is kind of difficult to recommend this to anyone for the time being. if the display did not have these pixel issues i could see this easily being a 4 star recommendation. if you do a little research you will see that there are definitely some lot numbers that are more problematic than others, so this is not just a rare incident. if it is for you and you plan to grab one from a brick and mortar location, do yourself a favor and just boot it up before you drive home.	Google Phone
i bought this intending to use it as a music and video player, so i can save battery for my phone. we got two, one for me one for my child. mine works perfectly for what i bought it. all my music is on it with no problem. i did have to download an app to play my wma files, but that was simple enough. my child's tablet is primarily used for app games, and i am told it is working just fine.	USB-C Charging Cable
ok tablet.decent size screen graphics. was hoping i could mirror my phone to it but it doesn't have miracast.	ThinkPad Laptop
we bought this for our 3 year old because she enjoys playing games on my ipad. this is a much cheaper alternative should she drop it. android apps so she can get most of the same games and apps. timer apps available so i haven't checked to see if you can limit time on the device itself. bonus is the size, it is perfect for her.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i was skeptical about the fire os, apart from being a windows phone user and then used android a little on nexus tab, i found fire os a little annoying and not easy to use. but then just after 23 tries you get used to of and works fine. the tab is fast with quad core processor and good ram. i was thinking to install android, i bought two of these so the one which i want to gift someone i'll install android it, although i myself will try fire os for a while and then decide.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
we bought this kindle fire for our autistic grandson. he seemed to fight with it trying to connect to the internet. after 3 adults tried and tried to connect it to the internet, it finally connected. every time he comes to our house, we have to fight again to get it connected. we decided this was not the unit for him or any other kid. so, its back to the mini ipad.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is an average performance tablet and amazon centric. this tablet could have been better if amazon would have made it with android os instead of poorly designed fire os. the app store and apps in that are not great. this tablet can be good for people who wants to read while travel or play some games while travel will be good. i paid only 35 so cant complain for the price i paid. i already have ipad mini 2 and comparing with that makes this tablet little slow.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i like to refer this product for low budget tablet future owner. it has all the features needed in tablet at lower price. good display, long battery life, good wifi connection, better speed	USB-C Charging Cable

this device is pretty nofrills, but for a 7 year old boy, it works great and is awesome. it's sturdy, plays apps well, and i don't have to freak out every time he drops it. i'm sure it will break eventually my son will find a way, but for 50, i'll take my chanes.	Flatscreen TV

tablet is ok. it does display ads on the lock screen, that you can't opt out of, to my knowledge. but for the price, i can't really complain. i bought it at the 35 bf price. i wouldn't let me download instagram for some reason either.	Lightning Charging Cable
this product definitely gets the job done plus more! plus i couldn't beat the low price offered by best buy!	Apple Airpods Headphones

not happy that the product had no instruction book to go with it to help set it up. not a big fan of the online tutorial. had a really hard time in powering it off. camera setting did not take very good pictures. did not like the multiple ads on it every time i used it. finally it locked up on me and i had a hard time getting it to go to settings so i could do anything with it. probably will be returning this product to best buy.

well primarily i was going. to for a samsung galaxy but for the price i went with this kindle for my daughter to use i do like the parental control features i just wish amazon was a full android device instead of limitations to app markets i can't even get google play. unless you jail break it. well for what it does it works fine just not the top of the list.

had to buy two for each kid of mine. they absolutely love it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
first, bought it 15 days before it went on sale everywhere. next, store doesn't tell you about all the ads offers that come with it and you must pay 15 to disable them. performance is slow keypad is slow, am typing faster than it can register resulting in lots of typos. watching movies is decent, but sound could be better. it drops wifi more than i'm used to. have several apps that cannot be installed on it and a few that consistently crash. good battery kifre, but quite slow to recharge. sometimes the ""keys"" stick and can't get out of something even with home key, must restart. thought this would be cheap temporary solution but this is better served by my 5 year old grandson.i got 50 worth of tablet.compared to the look and feel of my old ipad, its like i'm still using a vcr and everyone else is on blue ray.	Wired Headphones
my 6year old twin boys loves technology and the fire 7 tablet is perfect for them. just the right size to sit and play or pack and go. the icons are super easy to understand for beginners as such. i've downloaded fun games, apps, and books for them to utilize already. the price was awesome as well especially since i purchased two at the same time.

i've purchased several kindles over the years this is the only one that has given me issues. purchased this one exchanged it. i eventually exchanged the exchange for the same reason. the first two kindles didn't want to turn on would freeze. so far this one hasn't had any issues what so ever does everything my mother needs it for downloading thousands of books watching videos nonstopdocked a star due to complications with the first two. if i have to visit a store within the first month of a purchase twice, that is an issue.

love this tablet! it does everything! accesses the web, downloads apps, games, music, movies,. you name it. i also purchased a cover and stylus pens for this tablet. for under 80 you wont find a better deal!	iPhone
i bought this tablet for my 7 year old. great beginner tablet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased the new kindle tablet not really knowing what to expect.i didn't read any reviews before hand, nor did i try the one in store. after getting home, charging, and applying updates i noticed there are numerous brightstuck pixels at least 8. it's only noticeable on dark screens. i understand the devices limitations verses price but you would expect to at least have a functional screen with maybe 1 pixel issue at most.as i mentioned above when you plug it in and turn it on it immediately starts an update, that process took a good thirty minutes to complete. upon first boot i went to register with my amazon account but it returned some funky error message, i tried again and it said the device was already registered, so i was unable to complete the setupwalk through. i'm a very technical user so this wasn't too big of an issue, but i could see where it could be for someone that isn't savvy with computerstablets.all that said in use, it runs decently, and def better then you would expect a tablet at this price point to run. it's not a power house perse but for what it's built for, consumption device, it does everything from play movies, music and casual games with out a hitch. the ui is realitivley snappy as well.pros price ips screen viewable at most angles works well with the amazon eco systemcons mono sound 1 speaker poorly placed on back of unit stuck pixels out of the box low resolution device registration issuesin closing i would recommend to friends as long as they understand it's limitations.	Lightning Charging Cable
i was looking for a good, cheap tablet for general use, and this fit the bill. the one thing that hits you outright is the buildin marketing amazon uses in the tablet that you cannot remove. for instance, the home screen is filled with links for amazon video, amazon books, amazon gifts, etc, etc. you an't remove them, but i found out you can create a folder and drag each into that folder to essentially remove them.after that, install a free app for a file manager then go in and rename the folders that you create to make it easier to find apps that you hide. you will also need to install adobe reader to read pdf files, since it isn't installed.another marketing scheme is that the screen saver is an ad each and every time you wake it. after a while though you get to ignore it.performance is great fast and easy to navigate. the builtin browser has everything you should need. battery life looks really good. i had the screen brightness at about 12 power and it looked good. the screen black level is really good and the contrast makes the colors sparkle. if you turn the brightness up too high, the colors begin to wash out a little.amazon seems to offer this tablet at a lower price in exchange for their promotions of amazon products. once you get around that, you see the value you get in this tablet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
nice amazon fire tablet but.the camera is not clear enough 2.0 megapixels and amazon fire is very slow wedsite and app it takes very forever download i think i have to returned on best buy and buy a good tablet 10.1 lenovo and samsung galaxy.i will gave a zero rating star	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it works great. not affected by the singular wifi band at all.battery life is amazing.just be sure you can get the apps you'd like from the appstore, google play isn't accessible. so if you're looking for snapchat, instagram, nbc, comcast, vudu, you won't get those here.returning it. which is too bad, i really enjoyed it. more bang for the buck if you could access those apps. but like i said, it was my fault for not checking first. i was expecting the 'apps from unknown sources' to kick in but it so didn't.

does the job.does the job.great	Bose SoundSport Headphones
just bought it and not really happy i really expected more from amazon	USB-C Charging Cable
apps run okay but the real problem is streaming and internet browsing. i'm telling you, generic tablets are faster. i thought it was my internet at first but all my other devices work phenomenally fast. i first noticed this after i started using it but i thought i would give it a shot. i've decided to return this and exchange for another 50 tablet tomorrow. this is because i couldn't even watch a simple youtube video today.here's what i did like. it's name brand. the games are nice and mostly ad free. it uses android 5.0 but uses their own app store. reading books is great. library app is kinda slow but still works.perfect cheap tablet for kids age 6 to 13 maybe.	Macbook Pro Laptop
you cant go wrong with this tablet. i use this for media consumption but mainly for my 8month old baby to bring around and play nursery rhymes. had a 4gb micro sd laying around, filled it with videos and downloaded a video player app. no more worrying about losing an ipad or my phone tied up with playing his videos. get the 16 2 yr warranty from amazon too. theyll replace tablet 3 times within 2 yrs no questions ask.

bought for my 3 year old so she could be like her older sisters and this little device doesn't disappoint. i wish there were more silicone cases available for it and i absolutely can't stand the ads amazon puts on these fire tablets.	Lightning Charging Cable

let's be perfectly clear, this is not an ipad. but for 50.00 this 7"" fire is a steal. i'm very happy with this purchase.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
for the price i paid not having hd on the kindle was no matter. has lots of storage and the kids are using it at school for their class assignments. screen is big enough to read off of and everything is loading fairly fast. kindle looks to be durable.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i do most of my things on my laptop but i wanted something to use while watching tv and so on. i saw this tablet and had to look twice because i thought maybe it was just a reader! i have used this installing apps, playing games, reading, texting on a free text app, facebooking and so on. the apps are a little sluggish to install but once they are on they are speedy and work well. the clearness of the screen is so much better than any low line tablet at this price range. the tablet feels of good quality. it is not flimsy and cheap feeling. we bought two and are extremely happy. the trick is not to expect it to run like and upper line tablet. love it for what it is	iPhone
i purchased this amazon fire. because, reviews are good. but, i realized they left reviews before they receive it.i found couple of issues not to buy this tablet.1. it is impossible to use google account.even you can log in gmail account.2. bad for web surfing. there are so many limits for web surfing.3.this issue is only for koreans. it is impossible to type see korean language.do not buy this tablet if you are korean.i do not know why this tablet does not support korean. even supports other asian countries languages as like chinese, japanese. etc.	27in FHD Monitor
the tablet is certainly a good value but the wifi signal drops frequently and even when it shows its connected can fail to download any data. perhaps this is a glitch that will be fixed in a later sw update but for now i have to say the performance is underwhelming. the backlight also has some serious bleed issues which is a sign of an inferior design and or workmanship. the fire 7 hd which i also own has none of these issues. get what you pay for rings true again.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great price. my kids 5 years old love it, they can download games and browse the web without a problem.	USB-C Charging Cable
a solid well made tablet that feels good in the hand. images are crisp clean. works well with my hulu acct, hbogo acct, prime video acct too. the first few secs the video is blurry, then it clears up and plays fine. if you add a sd card the tablet automatically places apps video on the sd card if app allows the great value for me is you can download amazon prime video must be a current member onto the sd card for offline viewing. i bet a lot of parents will love that for those long car trips. sound is good. bt worked well with my bt enabled stereo i streamed prime music pandora. don't be put off by the screen resolution it looks great. the new bellini os is a major improvement over the old carousel format of days past. the new amazon app underground also adds to the value for prime members. the lock screen ads are not intrusive, once you swipe to unlock tablet they go away and do not reappear until you lock the screen again. if you're a prime member this is the best 50 bucks you will spend!	iPhone
the fire 7 has a great price! you get your money's worth. however, you may have to do an exchange if you get a damaged one. the one i bought had a busted pixel in the screen. there was no damage to the case or glass screen, but the image had a bright white puncture hole in the screen's image. i've owned multiple, but i have never had this problem before with an epad tablet when i just bought it. i will now have to visit best buy again tomorrow for an exchange. i'm hoping they're still in stock. it's not best buy's fault. the fault lies with amazon. they're clearly not that durable.

the kids were loving these as christmas gifts but here we are 6 months later and the battery charging port barely even works. we have to hold the charging cable at a certain angle for it to even charge. i wasn't expecting a super long life out of these tablets at 39.99 a pop but should've lasted longer than 56 months. very upset with 4 sad kiddos.

according to my girlfriend, it is slow, but functional for simple things like web and watching tv. i bought it for game development testing and have been satisfied. seems like an very good piece of hardware for only 50. suspect amazon keeps the price low because they intend to make their money on selling you content through their lockeddown store. it is an android tablet, but most of the google software you're used to is not there, which is the biggest downfall.

i purchased an asus 2 in 1. i love it. it was so much easier to switch all my documents and load programs from my other pc. the only problem i had was the facial recognition. it kept saying it did not recognize me and got locked up. customer service was very nice and got me going again.	20in Monitor
very basic tablet which i purchased mostly as an ereader. it's battery life is quite short. as a reader it is poor in the sunlight. i'd recommend if the price point is important, but you get what you pay for.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
got it to play games or get info when waiting at dr app	Lightning Charging Cable
it does most everything the higher priced tablets do. the advertising is annoying. it's possible to combine all of the icons for stuff you never use or want into one icon file.	USB-C Charging Cable
it is everything it promised. i use it to download books.	Lightning Charging Cable

we bought this amazon tablet because my 3 year received one as a gift for her aunt. my 2 year was using an ipad but kept dropping it. this is great because it's small enough for him to hold and if you buy the case it's completely protected. the only issue we seem to have is that the power cord is really loose when you plug it in to charge so sometimes it does not get charged. that is the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars.

i brought this tablet in december of 2016 for my mother. she uses it regularly now for streaming videos and reading emails. the camera quality is horrible. i would suggest buying another tablet if you want decent pictures. also, consider that many of the amazon tablets come with ads as screensavers. to avoid those ads, you can typically pay a one time fee or buy the exact same version for a higher price. looking back now, i definitely would have given this to my baby brother and brought my mother the newer fire tablet with a bigger screen.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
very good deal! quality top with very good price!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i bought the kindle oasis for my wife as a 37thanniversary gift. she enjoys reading and i thought that being able to adjust the text size would be very nice. she tried it for a few days and didn't care for it. she writes notes in the margins and wasn't happy with the way the kindle did its notes. for just reading i think it would be a very nice product.

i am a flight attendant and i love this small sleek book! it is a must have. the only thing i would change is, i would add audio	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the thick edge makes it easier to read than the voyage and pw. very fast and responsive. i wish the devise was longer then it would feel more like a real book rather than a cd case	Macbook Pro Laptop
it fits easily into smallest purse so it's always at hand when waiting in lines while traveling. lightweight, especially without the case. shape of back provides easy grip. accelerometer allows it to be held in either hand. would like to be able to charge the reader and the case separate, but that's a minor thing.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my wife surprised me with this, and i wasn't sure i needed it. after all, i have a smart phone, laptop, surface and a minitablet . seems redundant, no?long story short, none of those other devices are optimal in bright sunshine. this one is. it has more capabilities than i am sure i am using. need to learn to read magazines on it. but it works well, and especially outside.

i had the book e reader when it first came out and then i opted for a mini ipad but the lighting and reflection on the ipad made it difficult to read both at night time and day time when sunny. i did not realize how lightweight the kindle voyage is until i got it in the mail. super easy to use and easy to transport! and best of all. reading on the kindle voyage does not strain my eyes. highly recommend this to my avid readers out there!

purchased it for my daughter. she love this very much. it is really good.	USB-C Charging Cable
i've had a kindle since they first came out and was happy to get one with a backlit screen. i like the wifi and the 3g because i like the freedom of downloading books and newspapers while in the car, at the beach, by the pool when another guest recommends a new book. i still haven,t figured out some of the buttons, and because it is smaller i am always turning the page. i have adjusted the font and how far apart the lines are, but it still seems like i'm doing more page turning.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had been using a kindle fire hd for a couple of years, but over time found i was mainly using it for reading. i had been considering switching to a pure ereader for a while, but was not convinced until i saw some specs on the voyage. i ordered it right away and have been very happy with it.

like that i can use it in so many ways. as a computer or a tablet	Apple Airpods Headphones
the kindle and cover were a gift for my wife. her previous one went to the big tech heaven in the sky. she loves both products and couldn't be happier with the products.	USB-C Charging Cable
replaced paper white with voyage.amazing screen!	USB-C Charging Cable
easy on the eyes. smaller and even better than earlier versions	27in FHD Monitor
as above a high class e reader. love it. use it at least 23 hrs daily.	Wired Headphones
i really like the smaller size reader, and being left handed the ease of use of the haptic page turn buttons are very easy to use. i don't even use the touch screen page advance any more, with the haptic advance this can be done from the right or left side of the reader, an advantagefor us lefties. this is my fourth kindle, i keep upgrading due to all the changes and advances, i use my kindle every night and enjoy it very much and would highly recommend if you want to upgrade to the voyage, visit your local best buy and hold it in your hands and feel and see the difference.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
no complaints works great and the battery is awesome as always	AA Batteries (4-pack)
had the original kindle and filled it. upgraded to the kindle voyage and absolutely love it!	USB-C Charging Cable
got this as a gift for friend of mine they have been very happy with this can't believe how light it is and how well you can read the text. if you're up for him and don't want to be caring around an ipad or have battery life on the product while you're on location this is a must take with you product.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
best e reader to date. yes it's a bit pricey, but it reads like a real book.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
very happy and satisfiedeasier to handle. fast charging	USB-C Charging Cable
i needed something to read in the sunlight other than fire hd	Lightning Charging Cable
enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. initially disappointed by the small size, but i quickly learned to appreciate it. very portable and convenient. i wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3g connection so i did not have to be connected to wifi to download books. was a bit more then i wanted to pay but feel i will get good use out of it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i had a hard time finding a case for it at best buy	Wired Headphones
i got this product for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it. he uses it all the time for reading. when i held it myself, i couldn't believe how small and lightweight it was. very cool	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
pricey? yes. for serious readers and users of library ebooks, completly worth it. while nothing beats a real book experience, traveling 4 days plus per week nothing beats the portability and ability to add from the library or amazon on the fly. never have to seek out light to read by a noticeable improvement in the backlight, exceptional direct sun readability, not affected by polarized sunglasses. great battery life. great build quality. i expect it to last a long time. only upgraded as i lost my last kindle on the train.	ThinkPad Laptop
i gave my paperwhite to a friend and bought the voyage. i like the clearness of the screen and how easy it is to turn pages. i don't know that it's really worth all of the extra cost compared to the paperwhite, especially since the new one just came out with 300 dpi.	iPhone
the back light nad easier to read in all lightings	AA Batteries (4-pack)
if you read novels, biographies, anything you need this! free download of thousands of books from your local library. or email pdf's to a special email address and read them here. imagine being able to take 100's of books to the beach for a few ounces, and read them in full sunlight. the high resolution screen is great, as is the feature that lets me automatically sync the last page i was reading on my kindle with the kindle reader on my android cell phone. i really like the convenience of the free 3g cellular coverage.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a fantastic product for reading books. it is wonderful to use in full sunshine. i have a kindle fire so i thought this would be unnecessary now i am wishing i had purchased it sooner. the much longer battery life and use in full sunlight make it so much better to use for reading than the kindle fire.	27in FHD Monitor
very easy on the eyes. easy to carry, fits in my purse	Apple Airpods Headphones
this kindle is so sharp and turns pages quickly. i can finish books quickly and store so many on here. perfect!	Wired Headphones
i've had amazon kindles since v1. each new release surpasses the one before it, as you would expect, but does so in ways that always improve the user experience. i love the feel of this one great size, great weight, and i love the backlit screen.	USB-C Charging Cable
the touch control, page change controls, are a little to sensitive. web browser ""too"" experimental.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
like the smaller size. can read in sunlight or no light. carry in my purse to read when have time.	Wired Headphones
i wanted this when i first heard about it. my husband surprised me for my birthday. it was the best gift. love love it	Apple Airpods Headphones
the kindle voyage is the very best ereader that i've ever used. the light is great and does bother my eyes in the the dark at all ipads, fire and nook tablets bother me in dim light and extended reading while providing light read by. the controls are simple and easy to learn. however it is slightly pricey. for me the quality and relief are well worth the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought the voyage kindle as an anniversary present for my wife and she loves it. the new dim light feature and matted glass screen are pretty amazing and work like a charm. she's able to read in all manner of lighting and places. this is a great ereader.	Wired Headphones
note, the information on the best buy site is wrong, this is not a 4g device but rather a 3g device. it really makes no difference but just for clarity, lets get it right. very light and small ereader with a very good display and the squeeze functionality for page turning is a nice addition. not a revolutionary device but evolutionary.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a great reader, it feels like the best evolution of the paperwhite. the autobrightness works fine and is unnoticeable and it feels good in the hands. the new page squeeze feature is nice as is the haptic feedback when you squeeze the bezel.the power button is also much better placed now and the glass screen makes swiping and tapping the bookmark and location corner areas much easier. the backlight is now much more uniform than my 1st gen paperwhite.the only issue i have is when displaying black blocks like the tree silhouette, i have what looks like a tiny bad pixel that kind of twinkles. and of course, this thing is expensive when compared to the paperwhite.	20in Monitor
the kindle voyage is definitely the way to go. i bought this kindle to replace my 1st generation kindle because i wanted a more compact model and the 3g capability this one offers. i am definitely a fan!	USB-C Charging Cable
i just loved it . it was really nice . i would definitely recommend to buy the product	27in FHD Monitor
fast, solid, all the necessary features for an ebook. i like the side pressure page advance and the small size fits my small hands.	Wired Headphones
replaced original paper white with this new model and the recipient just loves it!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
love the new voyage bc it is lighter and smaller. easier to tuck in my purse. the other plus is the auto light feature.	Vareebadd Phone
excellent ereader, with great download ability. i really do not need the 3g as most of my downloads are through my pc.	Wired Headphones
i love this ereader. my other reader was not backlit so needed something i could use in low light. this works perfectly for reading at night and in the sun. the light is adjustable. love downloading books from the library. it has a 3g connection which i have not used yet, so far used only in wifi areas.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchase this for my wife it work well but i think that this version es too expensive, the difference is a light	20in Monitor
this is a great little tablet for what you're paying for it! gets everything done that i need it to	Apple Airpods Headphones
easy to use and great value. excellent viewing with good color	Wired Headphones
love my kindle! so when mother table died i brought her this and now i don't get calls all the time to help her figure out where everything is	Apple Airpods Headphones
bought it for my wifes yoga training course.so much cheaper than buying all the paperback books she needed, and she loves it!cheaper books, music, emails. what more do you need?	Vareebadd Phone
bigger screen, longer battery life and faster loading.an improvement over the last model and a great choice if this is your first tablet. as a college student, it beats spending more on books and having to lug the extra weight on my back	Apple Airpods Headphones
long battery life, good screen, reasonably fast. alexa.	ThinkPad Laptop
this is my second kindle fire. the 6th gen is an even better experience. glad i preordered.	iPhone
has been on my granddaughters kindle for many month and still working great	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this case is sturdy and will stand upright so that you can watch a video or read a book hands free. it fits easily in my purse, not bulky at all. the only bad thing is that the case only comes in a dark ugly color. should offer at least one other color, preferably a light color.

having received my fire tv today, i've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.setup was a no brainer. it required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.the image quality movies and games is excellent. i've tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell.navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.the remote works very well. i haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when i have tried it, it worked well. the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote.i only have one gripe. as far as i can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members. this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime, for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what's available for prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for prime. i'm sure this isn't an oversight. i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buyrent things but if they really want to compete with netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.perhaps i just haven't found the way to search for prime available content. i hope that's the case or i will really be disappointed.read more	iPhone
i'm your typical middleaged woman i don't game, and i'm not super techsavvy by any means.so take this review for what it is. the fire tv was easy to install and i'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! we've always just had our comcast cable service without dvr and occasionally used comcast ondemand to watchrent movies but i'll never watch from comcast again. the voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what i was looking for every single time i searched. it's just so easy to find what you're looking for unlike comcast, and since i'm an amazon prime member most of what i want to view is free oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from amazon is on average cheaper than comcast ondemand by a 1 or more. so happy with this purchase!	Lightning Charging Cable
an amazon.com official commented on this reviewwhat's this the amazon team saysjuly 30, 2014hi dallas, thank you for sharing your feedback. we wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite prime content with the click of your remote. you can now browse many more primeonly categories, including top prime tv, top prime movies, prime tv for kids, prime movies for kids, prime tv by genre, and prime movies by genre.

i am not a casual user of ondemand content and devices. having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvdbluray players, apple tv, wdtv, htpc, chromecast and too many other competing products to mentionfor streaming content, before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweakingfirst is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features like amazon's content.the second option you could consider was rokuwhich really means a roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku 3. it is for that reason you will see me address the roku 3 so often in this review.i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.wdtv are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.chromecast is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use no remote included!, is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome's browser not at the same quality level. this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than firetvrokuapple tv. but if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 13 the price of these devices.smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.read more	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. i got this to replace my kindle paperwhite which i still love, because i wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. it's a great little tablet that does so much of what i wanted it to do. the stand by time and play time are better than i thought they would be as well. i love the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. the only other thing i really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add google play store.

really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.seems to be ok so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. my wife bought a nook at the same time and i have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the kindle fire	AA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent price for a tablet. hit for my daughter, she loves it!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
difficult to purchase. no stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. when it did become available it did not work. once it turned on, i couldn't get any further. i could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item.	LG Dryer
the kindle will never take the place of an ipad or samsung galaxy tab but they cost very little. perfect for kids and adults alike. especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. it's very simple to set up right out of the box. it works great with the prime membership. if you want to watch movies or hulunetflix, the ipad is superior for quality of picture. again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. if you just want something simple and hard to break think young kids or teens this is definitely the best option.

it was good, works pretty easily. the camera is good.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

for those that have prime this is almost a must have. keeps all your amazon stuff in one place.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the amazon fire os is not a perfect os but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. i would recommend checking the amazon store to ensure the apps you are thinking of using on a fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. the size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest hd screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain.	Apple Airpods Headphones
purchased for parents who wanted to use it for photos, music, books and social media. perfect size. the front and rear camera are easy to use and once we added fb, sharing photos was easy. amazon apps are native to the device, so we have access to plenty of kindle books. there are amazon ads on the kindle, but nothing that interferes with the overall usefulness of this device.

Wired Headphones
screen larger than phone. visual better.	USB-C Charging Cable
quite an upgrade from the original fire. the deletion of the carousel was a welcome change. the new turn style approach is faster and more consice. still don't know why a chime sounds? also miss the ease of making notes while reading. there has got to be a better way to organize books. trying to figure out series, trilogies etc. is impossible, and if you buy a series in a set then the chances are good that amazon won't pick up a new purchase as a book already read.

purchased for my 9 yr old nephew. such a great price, he only wants to play games on it. his brother broke his original tablet, so this repaved it. he's happy! i also bought me one!	USB-C Charging Cable

i bought a kindle fire 16gb for my 6 year old son in june. after 4 months the charging port came loose and the device will not charge. best buy is aware of the issue and will do nothing about it. amazon will not warranty their product for more than 90 days and they said the charging ports often break if children are using them! they have no options to fix the device and only offer a small discount if i buy a new one. amazon does not stand behind this product. they are aware of the defect and continue to sell these.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it's amazing. my daughter loves reading on it, watching netflix, going online to look things up, etc. she loves the touchscreen aspect, and the settings are advanced, but very user friendly. easy to navigate. lots of great features for a very low price. the only negative is that the camera is not the best quality. but that's not important to her.	USB-C Charging Cable

we bought three including one for my 2 year old. we all love it! the only complaint is the volume. there is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. it doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 45 stars. overall a great tablet.	27in FHD Monitor
i bought this kindle because i needed something light and portable to take with me to class throughout the day on an 85 schedule. and so far, no complaints! only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but i knew that going in. battery lasts all day, which is awesome since i keep all my notes on it. touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? it does the job and does it well.

the kindle fire is a great tablet and reader. everything you need in a tablet at a much lower price.	Flatscreen TV
got this when it was on sale mainly to get the books not available bn and to play audiobooks. main drawback the constant advertising! you turn it on and get a ad. let it sit for a moment or two, another ad pops up. ads for nothing i've ever expressed an interest in. very irritating.color is very crisp and clean.love my older nook but lately bn doesn't always have the books that are available on amazon. will continue to use the nook as my primary ereader with the fire as my primary audiobook player.

i bought the 16 gig fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before i went on a trip to iceland. my plan was to use it to read kindle books i had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. since it was a wifi only device, i was dependent on the hotels i stayed in to have wifi. no problem there, they all had free wifi. this was great since i had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.there were three bonuses internet access, games solitare, sodoko, etc. and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my slr to take pictures, i could use my camera on the fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. the fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and i didn't have to take it out for tsa screening. all in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, i had subscribed to the washington post before i left and that meant i could keep up with the political news and hurricane matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit iceland and bite us. only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. good thing i had my own personal entertainment systemfire 7 tablet.

i ordered this online on black friday, i live about 30 miles from nearest store and i saw the special on their website, so why not i thought. came in yesterday. maybe it's just because i'm not familiar with this product i'm used to android tablets that have you set up with your google account. this one you set up with your amazon account. ok, no big deal i thought, at first. then i found it very difficult to install the free 6 month webroot it came with. i went to google play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. when i contacted amazon customer support, i was told i can't use google play on it and to use the app store instead. i was given a link for webroot installation but it didn't help. i downloaded google chrome but can't find it on the device. no youtube, facebook, gmail apps won't install. again, maybe i'm just not used to the product but if i can't use google apps on it, i won't like this. it's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, lol, i don't think he will like this either. so i'm returning this hopefully can find an android tablet i like and affordable at best buy.

this is not like other android tablets in a bad way.	Vareebadd Phone

amazon's kindle fire line only gets better as price gets lower. this is my 3rd kindle fire purchased, the first 2 still work well after daily use for more than 3 yrs. a sleeker new design makes the product look more relevant. some definate improvements over the earlier versions include the rear camera, moving the charging port to the top, and a crisper, clearer screen. the operating system seems to have been upgraded as well and now is more like a cell phone than a mini computer which i think helps it as well. holds a charge for a good while under normal use. am already thinking about replacing the other 2 to the newer generation models. absolutely will recommend amazon kindle fire to anyone who will listen.

we purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kidfriendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. the little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. i am over tablets. if you can buy it on black friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. so now he has no tablet because i am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me.refurbished. i am very disappointed.

bought this as a gift for my 2yr old. he loves it. couldn't tear him away from it even when the batteries die. wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so i attempted to add him to my phone plan. the only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a simcard, so my attempt was futile. its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. soon will be looking in to another tabletipad option that allows for the usage of a simcard some way or another when wifi isn't available.

my 7year old daughter saved up to by this. her brother bought the 8gb about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. the os is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. overall, ok first tablet for kids, considering the price. for adults, fine for ebooks and very basic apps. otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and os efficiency.

amazon fire is a good tablet if you like ebooks. it's also nice to get a sixmonth subscription to the washington post. their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on samsung galaxy tablets.

have some issues with library check out and amazon.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i read a huge number of books in kindle format. this kindle fire is perfect for that. it's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. it also is great for audible users you will want to install a micro sd card, though. you can also use it to watch netflix and the like, although i don't. as a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. if you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. it has a lot of system lag, and wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the google play store it's locked into amazon. none of that bothers me because like i said, i only use it to readlisten to kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. bottom line if you just want a kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. if you're looking for the full android tablet experience, look elsewhere.

nice tablet for games and keeping up on social media!	Macbook Pro Laptop
positivesnot overpriced and extremely userfriendly os. recommend that users purchase an amazon prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free tv shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. prices for items are also reduced. if not, there are occasional free and reduced price items however, you have to look for them.negatives if you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. this will require the user to return the item and purchase another. if the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. the display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would.	Apple Airpods Headphones
step son wanted a tablet and nowadays kids are up to date on technology so the kid friendly tablets weren't enough for him. perfect for kids when ipads are way too expensive for a first tablet	Wired Headphones

this product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. i think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and i like that the parent has to approve of the settings and gamesactivity for the child to use. i would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!

this is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. i read a ton so it doesn't last very long. other than that, i'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson can't remember her name handled everything for me.	Wired Headphones
good product and the quality of the product is good. easy to use.	Lightning Charging Cable

this has been a great purchase. it fits all my tablet and ereader needs.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was a birthday present for my sister, and she had no trouble getting it set up for use. i was happy to find one with 16gb, not an inadequate 8gb. my other purpose in buying it was to test on a cheap machine, just in case! a procedure for installing google's play store. that was a success, and i got a fire hd 10 for myself.	Macbook Pro Laptop
first got the fire stick so the tablet was a great addition.	iPhone
for a cheap starter tablet it's fine. bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it'll do for that.	27in FHD Monitor
i wanted to upgrade my kindle fire first edition. this one is really nice. graphics are superb as is the speed in loading. i don't know, yet, what else it can do as i haven't explored it thoroughly. it's like a mini lap top and has a camera that takes very clear pictures and has wireless connection to the internet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
was looking for something small i could use to get on the internet and check emails and this is prefect for that	USB-C Charging Cable
amazon fire 7 tablet 16gb has been easy for me to learn how to use. i like that i can read free books from the library. it has everything i wanted and is a nice size for holding.	Wired Headphones
this is the second amazon fire 7 tablet i have purchased, this time in a color other than black. this, like the first, has met all my expectations.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
too many advertising and too many pages to sort through.	20in Monitor
would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. all the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. over all for price it is a nice ereader.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

if reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this primarily to be used as a kindle ereader and this is a good product for this cost. the only drawback is that i cannot access all the apps available on the google playstore and have to be content with what is available on the amazon app store.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i had a kindle fire and upgraded to the 5th generation. could not be more pleased with this tablet.	Wired Headphones

amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love the tablet.i just can't do without the tabelt	Macbook Pro Laptop
i bought this as a gift for my sister and every time i see her she is using it. she does not have a computer or internet at home and is very dependent on the library. this works so well for her. a stop anywhere there is free wifi and she is online. so much tech utility for such a low price.	Lightning Charging Cable
i am a big fan of this tablet, very functional for price	USB-C Charging Cable
it works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. one other odd quirk. if the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. you then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. this is very annoying. before recommending to someone, i would tell them about this annoying quirk.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this kindle has good quality for the price i bought it for. it can basically do anything an ipad does, but it is a lot cheaper. i got the kindle when it was on sale . if you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough gbss.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the amazon fire tablet is awesome. my daughter loves it very much. it is very easy to access and download your apps. the settings functions are very easy to use and program.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

bought this as a mother's day gift. fits perfect inside her pocketbook for accessible use.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
not a substitute for an ipad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage.	ThinkPad Laptop
purchased for my motherinlaw for mothers day, she is not a computer person, the ease of use was great for her! just touch the pic!	USB-C Charging Cable
just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. had no idea i would not have access to google play store. beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. much slower than my phone or my other tablet. tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so.	Wired Headphones
i take it everywhere i go. it's got me back into reading again all the time. if you're a firsttime kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. there are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase.	Lightning Charging Cable
my daughter picked this tablet after her hd fire battery would no longer work. the insurance kicked in and she picked this one instead of the hd. she wanted more memory for her music does not use it to watch movies really. she loves the blue color and is working just perfect for her.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
good deal . purchased for my mother , killer mothers day present. get what you pay for	Apple Airpods Headphones
good product, great price. big improvement over my first tablet.	Vareebadd Phone
i bought this for my wife, basically just for reading books. she has come to love it. she is constantly reading. lighting wasn't an issue or i would have gotten the reader.when she isn't reading, i borrow it for puzzle type games, and it is great. not a ipad by any stretch but it is more convenient than the mini that she also owns. prior to the amazon fire she was reading on the iphone 6.a	Lightning Charging Cable
it works great it is handy to use to look stuff up fast and has some great features.i added a memory card to add movies and it works great for that at a great price	Lightning Charging Cable
it was just as described. i would recommend it to a friend.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought this for a family member to get her school books on as well as entertainment. she loved it and didn't put it down.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased this for my son. has room to upgrade memory to allow more books games. but the speakers could be better or located in a better position.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it does what i need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
liked the first one so much i bought one for the wife	34in Ultrawide Monitor
with a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the lowend tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. but it definitely lacks the features and hd display of its high end variant fire hd.	ThinkPad Laptop
returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's a fine tablet for the price the only problem i have with theach kids mode it's not what i was thought it's going to be i returned it back just be of this reason	Google Phone

the table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. i would recommend to others.	Apple Airpods Headphones

the kinde was really good and my dauther like it. it is very good product and i would reccomend this to al my firends and family.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a great tablet if you have reasonable expectations. and you should definitely pay the extra 20 for a total of 69 and get the 16 gb tablet. is it the fastest tablet out there? definitely not. does it quickly do all sorts of business spreadsheets applications, etc? no. does it do everything that an ipad etc can do? no. but at this price point it can't be beat. people say that you can't download chrome and the google playstore. they are wrong. i have both on this tablet and my other fire, without rooting them. and with the ability to add a 128 gb card it's a no brainer if you want to play games, watch moviestv, surf the net, email etc. i know there are a lot of people who dislike amazon and their products, but i am obviously not one of them.	Lightning Charging Cable
nice starter tablet for my nephew. does what we need it to do.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

this is my first fire and i love it! it is perfect for taking my books on the go without having the large bulky books!	ThinkPad Laptop
my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her kindle	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i wanted a tablet mainly to keep by my chair so i could look up stuff, such as information about movies i watch on tv, or answers to the new york times crossword puzzle, or anything else i was curious about. i didn't want to spend much money, but was still dubious whether such an inexpensive tablet could be any good. i decided that for a measly fifty bucks plus 20 for extra storage, it was worth a shot. i found that it's perfect for my purposes relatively fast and easy to use. i haven't used it for downloading or the like, but my guess is it'll be ok there, too. i'm happy i bought it.

i have always been a nook customer, but recently their models have not received good feedback. so, while shopping for a new ereader, i had to make the decision between the two. the biggest influence behind price. while the new samsung model of the nook definitely looks great, it also has a big price tag. overall, we are very happy with this purchase. it is mostly used as an ereader, but we have downloaded a few games. kindle is a good reputable tablet and is a good solid ereader.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it had apps he can use now and that will grow with him, easy to navigate	Wired Headphones
i has another and work real good it is not a expensive tablet	Lightning Charging Cable
i had originally bought my son the kindle fire hdx. and it worked great for him. the only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. but it only came with the front facing camera. as children do they break things. and he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. i did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why i chose this amazon fire 7inch tablet. and it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted. all the features are the same. it is a great buy. i would highly recommend it.

i can't update facebook and a few other apps. it's not what i expected.	Wired Headphones

love everything about my new tablet. good for on the go work related stuff or even just basic movie watching or emails.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought 2 of the amazon fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. i have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. if you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. the sound quality when i play music is terrible. i was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now i know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.

so my old kindle stopped working recently. not sure why but it would not connect to our new router. so i checked with best buy and saw they had kindle on sale for 60 which is a great deal for a color kindle tablet. i especially like that i can setup the reading mode which dims the tablet and removes the blue led light. so far i have read 5 books in the past 2 months on this kindle and it flawless.

my 5 year old loves his tablet. it's perfect for him.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this tablet to replace my textbook. it has everything i want and need. i only purchased it after i learned you can download from google play. the amazon equivalent to google play has a lot of the same apps and games.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i needed a device to listen to books on a long drive. this paired easily in the car and downloading the audible books was a snap.	Flatscreen TV

i purchased this table to use to check my email and get on facebook, but i use it for so much more. it is a great tablet for a good price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this tablet can be literally dropped over a thousand times and the screen wont crack. i bought the hd 6 when it came out for my daughter. i just had to replace it because it wasn't charging anymore, it wasn't the cord itself but the device on the inside failed to identify that the cord was plugged in.the best quality tablet i have ever seen. amazon has a great product and will never buy any other brand of tablet.	Wired Headphones
great product would recommend it this to others. have a great picture.	Lightning Charging Cable
i do not like this tablet one bit. it has to be registered with amazon for it to function and it failed every time. i finally had to resort to calling amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. there seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, i had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. i would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software.	Lightning Charging Cable
i'm very happy with my purchase. i bought one because my wife has one and is very happy with hers.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
needed to replace the old nook. looked at the fire and was a little unsure. at this price though you get more than what you pay for. i travel alot for work and this has earned it's place in my travel bag. well most of the time it's actually in my back pocket so i have quick access to it to get some reading done. for anything to be carried on my person during travel is high praise from me because that means it has value and importance.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it's great for beginners, like children, but very limiting for me. i can't use many apps because it doesn't allow me to use the google play store.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on netflix as well as amazon prime. she is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for my kids its a cheap alternative to an ipad mini and should they lose it or break it its easy to replace with little out of pocket.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my wife loves reading, and being able to have so many books to choose from is great. the price of the kindle is also great. if you factor in the cost of books. this was a great investment for her.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

great buy after owning the original kindle fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. you can't lose and pair it with amazon prime.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this tablet for my son. he damaged the previous one but it was good for his purpose. he loves to play the minecraft app and can read a book with ease. i don't have a tablet for myself. if i did, i would get the fire. all i would really need it for would be to surf the web and use the apps. for the price, u can't go wrong.

you can't do better for60. my only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. great for light browsing and kindle reading though.	Vareebadd Phone
you couldn't get a better buy for 59 than the amazon fire 7. paid the extra 20 to get the 16gb. well worth it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

here are my pros and cons thus far.properfect size for ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketchild accounts amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil johnny can play clash of clans and how much he can hit the ol' visa card for.battery life thus far wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46kindle integration this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my kindle books look great	Wired Headphones
i purchased this tablet a week ago as a gift for my brother and it has restarted itself over ten times and has shut off while someone was on in on different occasions will be getting my money back and getting a samsung.	LG Dryer
well made and profrssional looking. operating manual clear and complete.	ThinkPad Laptop
i bought two of these for two of my children. the parental controls are great and i can easily control their access to content. the ability to make them do something educational like read for 30 min before playing games is awesome. this tablet does everything i wanted it to do.	Wired Headphones
can't really give a full review since the kindle fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, webroot anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. i tried calling geek squad 4 times for support and was disconnected every time. i finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. i've ended up buying an ipad which is fantastic and would not buy again from bestbuy.

brought for my daughter and she loves it. wish it had more google stuff on it	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i like the size of this tablet. i have small hands and it fits. needs to have a cover a little slippery. easier to handle than my ipad	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.	Wired Headphones
this tablet is quad core cpu and has plenty of space for you to download more apps.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
the tablet works great when the battery is charged. the problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro usb port and does not have a solid electrical connection. therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery.

tablet is nice for simple use and is slim and light, good for browsing through emails and watching videos, tablet is a bit small for gaming but it will do everything else excellent.	Wired Headphones

my kids love them. able to do so many things with it!	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought one of the first macs in the 80s. i've had 'too many to count since then.' i am an early adopter, by nature. this has been true of amazon's kindle product as well having owned the first generation kindle, k2, k3 and now the k touch. love the reader. and i love this case as well. i hear all of these complaints that this leather case looks cheap or doesn't have a closure, or it's too slippery. please. i find it to be a perfect fit for the kindle touch. the unit snaps in a la dodo case which is such a great product for ipad. very similar design only on a much smaller scale, obviously. the leather is not an issue for me. i do not find it to be too slippery at all unless, perhaps, your hands are covered in oil this is a first class cover for a first class ereader. and no. i do not work for amazon. i'm just a huge kindle fan.	20in Monitor
overall it's a nice looking cover and does it's job well. it's simple, elegant and slick. when i say slick, i don't necessarily mean cleverly devised, i mean slippery. the smooth leather provides next to no grip on the cover. i have a tendency to hold things lightly, so i can just imagine this repeatedly slipping out of my hand. sure it doesn't have a bandclaspetc to keep it closed, but neither did kindle 2's cover, and neither does nearly every book ever published.it's too expensive. i don't understand why amazon is charging so much considering they'll be offering another cover with additional functionality for half the price amazonbasics leather folio cover with multiangle adjustable stand for kindle touch, kindle black. what the heckprosprettyfunctionalconsslipperyexpensive	27in FHD Monitor
so in reading the reviews before i got this cover i was quite worried. lots of people reported it feeling cheap, flimsy, overpriced etc. i was so concerned in fact i tried to cancel my order. i'm glad i wasn't able to.it is perhaps not what people expect the leather is not soft, but is rather pressed and almost polished. however, this cover does not feel cheap to me. it is stylish, super light, and fits the kindle without those annoying elastic loops or hooks on the corners. it fits within a rubberized groove on the cover, which not only gives it a very tight and secure fit, it also adds protection to the corners of the device and cover. it also feels quite secure in the hand.so, to sum up light, secure, well made and unobtrusive. the 40 price tag could be debated, but i actually don't find it to be overpriced. i'm quite happy with it!	Flatscreen TV
i don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. however, i'm not sure how amazon justifies charging 40! half that and i'd feel a lot less disappointed. it's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. that thing could take a beating! this one umm.not so much.pros i really like the solution amazon came up with to lock the kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it very securely. no more metalprong sliderelease gizmo. it looks quite nice and is genuine if untextured leather like the last one.cons flimsy. the leather is extremely thin and unpadded. won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it. the actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. i could bend it in half with almost no effort, if i had the notion. cover has no lockclosure mechanism like the elastic strap on the last gen model. it should have something.oh, well. it is what it is. i never read with the kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but i was expecting more. especially for this price!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the touch cover from amazon has some good and some bad properties.on the good side, it's very light at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. my kindle touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.on the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. i ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. at first i thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. the front inner cover is a soft felt. the inner body where the kindle sits is plastic. there is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.this is my fourth kindle and cover. the touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. it looks rather like an old palm pda cover i had, or like some ipod covers. the previous kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.right now i am having rather mixed reactions. i definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the kindle. however it does look rather cheap. for 40 i was expecting a little more.i think i am going to have to use this for a while before reaching a final conclusion.update november 29th tastes will vary, but in the end i decided that this was not the right look or feel for me and i have switched to a different cover the splash safari. that is similar to the old kindle 3 cover, with a textured leather appearance and an elastic fastener strap.	Wired Headphones
okay, so i have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing 3 or 4 stars, and i still want to rate it 3 and a half, but i have settled for 4 stars. here is why.prosthe only real reason i wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the kindle in with straps around the edges, and this is the only case that holds the kindle in while letting you see the whole front side. it holds it in perfectly, neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out. the black leather is genuine leather and smells nice, and while the front cover is very thin if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound, and it can be bent without much effort it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem. also, the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading, you hardly notice the kindle has a case on.consmy main complaint is the quality of the leather. if you compare this to the case for the kindle 3 keyboard the leather is a little thinner but much less durable. i sometimes lightly hold my kindle between my teeth when i run out of hands, and after a week i can still see my tooth marks whereas on the k3 case i couldn't. also, even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear. update most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as i originally thought.the only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed, but this has actually not been much of a problem for me. quite often i like to frisbee toss my kindle onto a nearby soft surface like carpet or a pillow or bed and i was afraid the cover would flap open every time, but 10 times out of the 11 i tried it stayed shut just fine.read more	USB-C Charging Cable

this is a good tablet for children and adults too. however there is an issue with the port and charger cable. we did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. so now i have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. its really frustrating.

my son loves it he's only 3 understands how to use it and i can see it has helped him learn word animals and etc. it's a very good way to keep the brain moving and active.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is great for any child. love the parental control and way it holds up. definitely recommend	Wired Headphones
as this product is made for children most would already assume that it is durable but i will go one step further and elaborate that my girlfriends 2 year old has dropped this multiple times onto concrete and the case has done its job and kept the kindle intact. i am very happy with this purchase as is the child. not to heavy and she can hold it with no problem.	ThinkPad Laptop
i am very happy with this purchase. keeps my grandsons entertained. easy to set up and use.	Vareebadd Phone
good tablet for young kids. battery life could be better	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my son washed it twice! throw it a few times and it's still ticking.	ThinkPad Laptop
it's all the great features of the fire but with added bonuses for the kids. the app for the kids is great and the case has held up to our two year old thus far.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this tablet has many educational games for a preschooler.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
he figured it out in no time. be sure to combine all nonchild approved apps into a folder. my only complaint is the 1 year free amazon freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. not everyone has home wifi. anyway, that's my only complaint.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
picked this up for my two year old granddaughter. she loves it and its the first thing she picks up to play with. she can play a lot of the age appropriate games and can navigate around really easily. i even use it sometimes!	Wired Headphones

i purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. they love it! it's easy and fun to use for toddlers. it's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this tablet for my daughter who was turning 2 but also because we were taking an 8 hour road trip and wanted her to be occupied. the games are very toddler user friendly and when she gets mad and throws it, it doesn't effect the tablet. my only issue is that the charger doesn't stay secure in the charger spot sorry i don't know the technical terms haha so sometimes i will think it is charging and in fact it is not. i recommend buying the warranty for issues like that.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use great cover and a lot of options for app games. my daughter loves it.	Lightning Charging Cable
my son loves his tablet! it's easy for him to use and he enjoys all the games that come with it. no problem with the storage or speed of apps. i previously bought him the samsung tablet and when that broke it was difficult to get it fixed. i like that amazon gives you a two year warranty.	27in FHD Monitor

i got this for ky 3 year old and she loves it. she has dropped it a fews times, once outside and it just bounced. i also love that i can set restrictions on play time, i can have it where this is no play time until a certain number of minutes of reading time has been completed. i don't have set times of the day that she can even get on it	Wired Headphones

i bought this tablet because it was very inexpensive and the right size and fit for my daughter.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we're avid apple users however the games that's are free in the free time area are amazing the way that amazon takes measures to keep the kids safe is like non other i'd definitely recommend this product just if you're used to apple it will take some getting used to.	Lightning Charging Cable
easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
so i bought my little guys these tablets. so that i could repossess my ipad. love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play netflix! so now. i'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my ipad back. and yes, i called amazon numerous times. they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again. the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart. then you have to wait to restart netflix. oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works. if it works at all	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this is a great tablet for kids. its got great parental controls and its easy for the kids to use. i even enjoy playing angry birds on it	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
love it for my boys! we received the 6"" kids edition for christmas last year. the screen cracked a month ago and amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. great 2 yr replacement plan! shortly after that, my older son who previously used a nook finally broke. i decided since younger brother had a kids kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the barnes and nobles nook. i love the fact that i can control what is on his profile. i love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. my boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. my son did however get a kindle with a pink case because it was all that best buy had in stock. i wish that cases were cheaper and i would gladly replace it. best tablet for this age and in this price range.cons no google play store, slow sometimes, have to redownload apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
my son loves it. easy set up. and the best part is the case. it really is childproof. my son has dropped it and nothing had happened. very durable. just what my son needed.	USB-C Charging Cable

i bought this item for my 9 year old granddaughter. she is thrilled with it. her only disappointment is that she is unable to access the ""musicality"" app.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
tablet is great! i bought it for my 6 year old daughter again first one finally got the screen cracked for christmas and she and i love it. it has all the features you would expect from an android tablet but with nice parenting aspects to keep the kids where they should be.	USB-C Charging Cable
love the apps. his old fire stood up to significant weartear and drops. so i'm expecting the same with this one. 2 year warranty gives piece of mind.	iPhone
the reviews on this on amazon seemed awesome. little did i know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. we just bought this for christmas and went to charge it for the first time. nothing. we already loaded and paid for several apps, and now we're out that money. also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before there's some wear at the edge of it. so i went online to see if i could find this issue and there it is everywhere. this is a problem that has been around for years, but android who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. when you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. it just slides in and out. we've had apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. this will be going back to bestbuy and will buy another ipad mini costs more, but is much much more reliable.	Lightning Charging Cable
just purchased as a christmas gift for my glambaby she loves it ! very nice case for little clumsy at times rough hands!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
they both love it! and, play or read all they can.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the color is what got me and the features was on point. the screen shows a lot of different displays. to share for now until the next one.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i'm a big fan of amazon and their products, but this tablet is just ok. the build quality is great and the image is very good, but the software is mediocre at best. worth the price.	27in FHD Monitor
we bought this for our 7 and 4 year old. the kids love it and it is simple to use. the ""kids"" profile makes it safe and easy to use and we can limit time of use. we can switch to our profile to watch netflix or use other apps if we want. comes with a great warranty and device protector. we're very happy with the amazon fire tablet.

it takes forever to download apps. i'm returning it will be getting something else.	Lightning Charging Cable
i own 3 kindles. they are my favorite hand held technology so it was an easy decision to buy my great niece one for her birthday. the case helps make it even more sturdy so it can stand up to being dropped more often than an adult would. it's easy to use and she loves it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it's perfect, my granddaughter loves it! she's catching on so fast and learning so much! easy for travel and on the go	iPhone
i think the price is great the durability the easiness although you do need to spend money as well for extra better games and the charger breaks easily but u can use any android charger overall well worth the price i believe	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my daughter loves her kindle. i swapped out the case for one with a handle so she can carry it but it's perfect for her	Lightning Charging Cable
got this for my 3 year old son. he plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.	USB-C Charging Cable
my 4 year old loves it. easy to function and pretty tough, it has been dropped a few times and did not crack or break.	Lightning Charging Cable
easy to set up and durable design. free time is a great feature, taking parental control to the next level. the screen resolution and camera are amazing.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
my kids love this and i love the fact that it is under 100 with warranty for 2 years added on. best buy has the geek squad that assists with repairs so that you don't have to ship it out. i also like the fact that it comes charged because come on lets be real, once the kids get it they want to use it right away.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is great for learning for little kids. easy set up. in about a hours time my 3 yrs grandson new how to navigate through the whole system. well made for kids in mind.	USB-C Charging Cable

USB-C Charging Cable
my daughter got this tablet for christmas and is very happy with it. the parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions.	USB-C Charging Cable
i did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. too much of the same thing.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy setup.bought this for 2 grandchildren under 5.they love it	AA Batteries (4-pack)
its worth every penny. the kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.	Lightning Charging Cable
great tablet for kids very entertaining and informative for kids learning	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this amazon tablet is perfect for first time users. easy to operate even for a 3 year old.	Lightning Charging Cable
the tablet has been working fine, i would prefer instructions on the pc to explain how to do things versus on the tablet itself, but my older son is able to figure out how to do things and my 7 year old daughter who got the tablet seems to be navigating around fairly easily, so i am satisfied so far.	USB-C Charging Cable
battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. didn't even last 4 hours one day. watches video mostly but should last longer than that.	USB-C Charging Cable
our grand kids really love this tablet and it has a lot of app options.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
seemed to be fine as chtistmas gift for granddaughter. however, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. don't know where to take it.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this for my 4 year old to play. it was not as user friendly as described and very slow. it keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. i was told that i would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. it may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us.	ThinkPad Laptop
this kindle is very slow at recharging. granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is the fourth one of these that i have purchased. my grand children love them. between the one year of programming and the two years of warranty, i don't think there is a better tablet on the market for children. excellent product and it works very well with the children at what ever level they are at.	Wired Headphones
she loves it. she is 20 months old and already has command of it. micky and minnie rule it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this was a christmas present for my niece, she loved it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it	USB-C Charging Cable
i love these tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. i bought 3 for christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. i also do not them touch the tablets while they are charging. they have only had their tablets since christmas day and they won't charge. i highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item.	Lightning Charging Cable
my granddaughters love the kid kindles that they received for christmas!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
my 2 12 year old loves this. he can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. great mix of educational and fun items. the only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. if they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge.	Lightning Charging Cable
great learning tool and tough exterior makes it the perfect gift for a three year old.	Flatscreen TV
my daughter loves her tablet i love free time love the case it came with just right to buy for a kids first tablet	Flatscreen TV
great for kids its durable and lets them play games etc. so they leave our cell phones alone lol	Wired Headphones
this tablet was an upgrade from the nabi jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. there are so many appsbooksvideos and it entertains her much more. the only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought 50 of these to use in a school education program. the workers at best buy assured me the apps i needed them to run would work fine. unfortunately i was not aware that amazon has it's own app store unrelated to apple and goggleplay. make sure whatever apps you want to run are also available on the amazone app store as not all are. specifically they block anything related to goggle. other than that the tablet is great and is a great price and really nice case.	Wired Headphones
we love this , so many apps that you can download for free easy to maneuver she will be able to grow with this	iPhone
got one for my son and hasn't put it down. well till the timer shuts it off. he is 5 and loves it.	Lightning Charging Cable
got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. she enjoys it slot and i enjoy the time limit. so win win.	USB-C Charging Cable

he loves being on it and all the freebies that came with it.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a good entry tablet for toddlers. i like the amazon exchange policy if it breaks.	Wired Headphones
my kid love this tablet! the setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! that my kid can enjoy playing and learning!	ThinkPad Laptop
my kids have grown up with technology in the house and their original tablets have started to become outdated. we have since switched to these fire tablets to help extend their gaming. while if they have never had a tablet before the speeds are ok but im afraid the processing power of these ""kids"" versions might lag over a short amount of time and they will just become a picture viewer. time will only tell.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is very easy to use i bought it for my nephew and he's only 4 years old and he love it	Google Phone
my daughter loves playing with this. there are so many features, that it keeps her busy.	USB-C Charging Cable

my grandson loves it. will be getting another one.	ThinkPad Laptop
my wife and i bought this for my 3 year old daughter to help keep her entertained during car rides, etc. well now she is completed addicted to it. i guess like many kids get addicted to their electronics. we just set limits to how often and when she can use it. there are also educational games and apps you can down load that help them to learn and prepare for school. my daughter loves playing these games also. overall a great purchase.	USB-C Charging Cable
our 5 year old grandson loved it. bought it for him to play educational games on.	Google Phone
i'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. but if the screen messes up when i'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.	Lightning Charging Cable
its pretty good for the price, my only concern is the quality of the picture, not an hd one, my daughter complain when shes taking pics.	Lightning Charging Cable

bought this for my 5 yr old grandson. great buy for the price. he loves his new tablet.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great for little kids the case on it is amazing. my daughter loves it. only thing i would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.	USB-C Charging Cable

i love this tablet. it's durable and my niece loves it	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
device size and speed are more than adequate for an 8 year old. i love freetime and the ability to set limits for weekdays and weekends so my grandson is able to play without my direct supervision. apps and books are age appropriate. i may have to buy 2 more for the 4 year olds.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great for kids. the bumper around the tablet has saved it several times. i might buy a larger screen tablet the next time around. the programs are easy to access and love the parental controls.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought two of these for both of my nieces birthdays and they were the hit of the party. both love playing with them	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought for my niece's 6th birthday, and it was her favorite gift. she really enjoys it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased the amazon fire kids edition 7 tablet 16gb for my 75 year old mother after she broke her old tablet by dropping it. it took her a few hours to get used to it. now, i cannot separate her away from it because it entertains her in so many ways and best of all she can drop the tablet and it will still work.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
unfortunately my grandson has broken the glass somehow.	Flatscreen TV
i love this tablet. i got one for each one of the kids all different ages and they all love it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better	iPhone
my 9 year old loves it. good control options. just need to figure out how to get the web browser on her side.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
as an existing amazon prime member, this is a no brainer. has all the parental controls and kids can have a decent tablet that is durable for use, at a good price.	Flatscreen TV
this tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. the kindleized android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular android tablet play store. space is also limited even on the large version.	20in Monitor
this item is perfect for children and great for parents. it provides a sense of security that it will not be damaged the first week a child uses it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. we wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. this thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight.	USB-C Charging Cable
great learning tool with extensive amounts of material to use. accident proof bumper a big plus!	iPhone
my nephew loves his kindle. durable structure that can withstand drops.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the tablet was a great fit for my 21 month old toddler. she is able to watch episodes of her favorite cartoons and play some of the apps with assistance. i like that she will be able to use the tablet for years to come just by updating to more age appropriate apps.	iPhone
the unit is well made and has tons of features for children six years and over. was amazed at the low price and how easy it to handle even for a six year old!	USB-C Charging Cable
i enjoy it a lot for my son yeah i really enjoyed it and likes it a lot of different options	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is the 2nd one i have bought. the first one went out before the 1 year. i contacted amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. it is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. i would spend the extra for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty.	27in FHD Monitor
it's an excellent learning tablet for a child. i would recommend that every parent that has a small child to get one.	ThinkPad Laptop
the grandkids love this tablet, easy for them to use	34in Ultrawide Monitor
great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi	Apple Airpods Headphones
great tablet for my 3 year old son. i am able to monitor his screen time and assure that he is only playing kid friendly and educational games.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
did a lot of checking around and found this to be the best value.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this tablet for my son and i don't like it. the touch screen is very poor quality. it's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. he prefers my ipad than to use his own. i know the ipad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! very frustrating. will be returning it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy for 3 year old to navigate. like the adult to kid use.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i'd suggest 812 is a good age for this tablet, it's a great starter tablet until your young one shows responsibility, care and proper use of electronics.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this was a life saver on our recent cross country flight. it was nice not having to worry if my three year old was too rough with it, knowing it had a great amazon warranty.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
grandson plays outside with it love that it has the protected case plays games with the other kids,	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
nice and easytouse for a 3 yr old .	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this for my one and two year old girls and i don't have any complaints! the battery life isn't great but i don't really mind that!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my son loves this thing. he is always on it. great learning tool and it keeps him entertained	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my toddler did not like this tablet. it was a bit slow for her. instead, she preferred an ipad over the kindle kids version.	Wired Headphones
my son already had one just upgraded. but he loves it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this has a lot of great features for kids and for parents who want to protect them. my kids love having their own.	27in FHD Monitor
nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate	Bose SoundSport Headphones
only good for kids and games. battery life is good.	USB-C Charging Cable
offers a lot for the price, good parental controls	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this tablet for my 4 year old grand daughter and she loves it.we set the parental controls for her age group, and now we don't have to worry about what she is doing on it. we downloaded her favorite disney movies onto it, and now she has her own little private movie theater. it also works great with our amazon fire tv and can watch a lot of her favorite kid shows. this is a great buy for the money and i recommend it to everyone.	27in FHD Monitor
it's a really good tablet for children good parental controls expandable up to 128 gigs i like that so it allowed me to download as many things for the children to utilize separate from the internet all around is a good device	27in FHD Monitor
great tablet for a toddler to start on! the parental controls can be fiddled with a little bit but good anyways!	Macbook Pro Laptop
i think the tablet is great it's plenty apps and books for children to read and interact with i also like the option that they don't just have books that you read yourself you can choose one that would read to you the tablet is just a good allaround device it allows you to add additional apps that you would purchase separate to it	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it was ok. you need internet. the sdmini is a hassle.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
my daughter absolutely loves her new tablet. and it does do everything i wanted it to do for her. the free year of amazon freetime is an awesome bonus! the only problem i have with it is that whenever your wifi gets turned off and then back on, your apps on the kids profile have to load again almost as if they haven't been downloaded yet. this happens if the wifi strength gets weak also and it really frustrates my daughter who is 4 years old. i wish that could be fixed because other than that, the tablet is great for my daughter and she has so much fun with it! i'm sure other kids will love it also!	ThinkPad Laptop
he loves it. he likes the camera and the apps, going to have to get one my granddaughter too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we bought 3 of these for our kids and they love them these are the best tablets on the market they have great learning apps on them aswell	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to hold, access to some free games just be careful if you have 1click payment option. my 3 year old charged 16 to my account in 3 days. good news i received emails about the purchases and was able to get help in stopping the process from happening too often. she loves the ""fire	iPhone
my son loves it. it does have some flaws though. when he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it's amazing! best gift i've bought for my grand babies so far!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
the kids couldn't wait to turn them on and i'm very excited.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
best buy assistance helped in describing the features. and loved the product overall. like parental control feature	iPhone
perfect for my son! he has fine motor deficits and the games definitely help him work on using one finger at a time to play them! i also don't have to worry about him getting onto anything that isn't kid friendly since he doesn't know my passcode for the adult profile!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
my daughter loves this! expandable storage helps when we make our twice yearly drive to texas and all the games and apps are definitely age appropriate so i don't have to worry about get getting onto anything she isn't supposed to be on!	Lightning Charging Cable

this tablet is very kid friendly. you log on the tablet and the kids is having fun.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my kids really enjoyed this tablet. its kid friendly.	20in Monitor
not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. very disappointing	Apple Airpods Headphones
i really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the amazon fire for kids is an excellent starter tablet. the supporting games and apps are exceptional. use of tablet is simple and nonintimidating.	Wired Headphones
i have a few issues with this tablet. mainly the fact that i can't get google services on it, not even youtube. aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. the port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
son loves this tablet and uses it everyday. nice to know that this has a 2 year manufacturer warranty. no questions asked.	Flatscreen TV
i love this this memory card. the price was good ty	Lightning Charging Cable
fun apps for kids along with some great educational apps and videos	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the value was there with a sale price reduction of 30. especially for the 16gb model. another key factor is the 2 year no questions asked warranty replacement. a valuable consideration for a tablet primarily used by a child.	Apple Airpods Headphones
we are super happy with the kindle fire. we had bought several dvd players for our vehicle that never lasted long due to living on a dirt road, and the kindle fire was a perfect fit for replacing them. now our almost two year old son loves the movies, shows, and games, along with the books that he can look through while we read. it also doubles as a tablet for me since it gives the options for different profiles. we love it!	Flatscreen TV
purchased the tablet for my 9 month old daughter since i notice that she loves phone screens and tablets. keep in mind isn't intend for kids her age but make sure there is adult supervision. pluses the tablet can take a good beating. tons of hard tapping and even with the tough case can even take biting as well without causing any damage to the pink case. daughter is teething lol . i'm a amazon prime member,which gives access to tons of shows and free apps. so if you have prime you can totally take advantage of a full library of entertainment. some of the apps are great even for my 9 month old daughter works great to keep her entertained. also when she is older i have tons of options to change and control. also i get my own side she can't do anything unless i give her action.cons average battery life 56hours tops of nonstop use and also wish that there was a way to lock the screen while watching amazon, netflix or any other video app so when my daughter taps in any direction or anywhere that the videos wouldn't stop playing.	Lightning Charging Cable
our young son spends hours fully engaged playing games on his tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
easy and age appropriate. can set timers for tv and movie watching my granddaughter finds the educational games more interesting and fun.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i actually purchased for a friends daughter and she is very happy	AA Batteries (4-pack)

my daughter loves her tablet. amazon has plenty of games for her to play. it is also easy for her to use.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
kids kindle was a christmas present for great grandson age 4. his mother has downloaded many word games and etc. from amazon's childrens library. a big feature of the kindle is the case and the 2 year no fault warranty. his mother says he loves the kindle and uses it all the time. great purchase.

would be lost without my kindle and kindle unlimited spend lots of time reading	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this has been a great replacement for my daughters leap pad. the parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. i really appreciate the usage timers they are customizable and i can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. the case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. on top of this, it is a fully functional kindle, and i am able to use it when she is not!

great for kids if you don't want to spend money on the ipad.	Wired Headphones
tablet is great. i am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. we started her at 10 months on an ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. i am not able to transfer her games and movies.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my kids love their amazon kindles! they can take them anywhere and play on them! great battery life!	27in FHD Monitor
my daughter absolutely loves this! it is very user friendly. my only issue with it would be that it doesn't come with a camera automatically installed.	Lightning Charging Cable
i am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. it is a kindle inside a kid proof case. you have to set up child locks, etc. my biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. i wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
my 5 year old loves her kids fire edition kindle! very easy for her to use.	Lightning Charging Cable

you can not block bing and it shows ""trending now"" news content. this can not be deleted or blocked. it also types ahead and adds content.	Google Phone
i didn't know how well he would do with a full blown tablet, but i am shocked at how well he navigates it on his own. he does get stuck from time to time, but a few times and key words and he can pull up apps, close them, pause and play movies etc by himself. his vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters and it has to be because of the tablet. i'm impressed at how well it holds his attention. his letter understanding he's 3.5 has transferred off screen to the physical materials we use. plus, it's a great motivation tool. i love it, and he does, too.

we purchased three of these tablets for our granddaughters and they use them everyday and enjoy them. we spoke with one of the best buy associates and he was great telling us about this product. made our decision easy. thanks.	USB-C Charging Cable
we had given handme down iphones to the kids to use for car trips and the like a while back and were looking to update them. for the price, this is the best deal. you have access to a lot of the same apps although you might have to start them over. it has a durable case. and is a good size for little hands. it is very helpful to be able to time activities so they don't have a choice about handing it back over. only downside is one of our cords doesn't charge as well as we'd like and sometimes it seems a little slow starting certain apps in comparison to our apple products. but if you don't want to pay the apple price, this is the way to go. kids will definitely be entertained by it!	Google Phone
great tablet. great performance and is stable. i have ipads and other tablets and i really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletthe kid version is kind of annoying. so.many. apps. ugh. and kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time.	ThinkPad Laptop
christmas gift for 8 yr. ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. kids. great 2yr protection tho	iPhone
wish the kindle fire for kids had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that gameprogram, which is clog download times. needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking. and clicking on every item. speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. app store is great and has many items.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my 2year old. she liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. if i hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, i think she would have been fine with this.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

got this for my 5 year old daughter and her and my three year old love it! lightweight, durable and loaded with books and games. what really sold me on this one over the other options was the 2 year anything guarantee that amazon offers!	Google Phone
love how easy it is for my 9 year old sone to navigate around. the unlimited kindle free time is great too we like that we are able to set time limits as well as only allow age appropriate games and content. our son not only loves playing minecraft and watching netflix on it but enjoys the reading the books as well.

this is the way to go for an allinone package for the kids. everything is setup and easily controlled through adult log in.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i mainly bought this so my daughter and i could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. the big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid.	Lightning Charging Cable

my daughter loves this. there are so many settings and you don't have to buy every app individual. so many books and educational apps	27in FHD Monitor
my children love the tablet. it's a good price and the apps that come with it are great.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. my mother bought him a subscription to the abc mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. at first i was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as i thought it was mainly for the case which i thought to be cheap silicon. when the tablet arrived in the mail i was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. it provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. it booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.the child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.you can set time limits on their account to your desire.you can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.it comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which i interpreted as basically prime for kids. this allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.the kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. he is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. it also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.overall i'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the internet holds if you're not careful.	Apple Airpods Headphones
very pleased with product. i was also a decent price and not overpriced.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my children think these are the greatest. i'm kind of partial to agree. you can limit their time, access and the things are built like a tank.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought this for my granddaughter for christmas. she is special needs and so far she shows an interest in the movies and games included on this tablet. she is able to easily use it with minimum assistance.	USB-C Charging Cable
i have not had any issues with it. i like the separate profiles so i can use it too with out him getting online. plus i can down load a app and if it is suitable for him i can add it to his profile.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
it's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure gamesapps are appropriate. battery life is absolutely terrible.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought 3 of these for my 4 year old, 6 year old and 9 year old. perfect for all ages. i love the amazon free time year subscription and the content is very age appropriate. i also love the ability to set the time settings for them. it also works as a regular kindle if you decide not to renew the amazon free time after a year.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought these for my grand children for christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their 'tablets' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet.	Macbook Pro Laptop

bought this for my 4 yr. old for christmas, she loves it and is very easy to use. the battery lasts a long time	USB-C Charging Cable
great for my 5 year old because he can play anything on there without having to ask me to install. in a previous tablet, he had to ask me to install games, videos, etc. but that is no longer the case. being able to set time limits is great as well. don't have to worry about him spending too much time on the device. he understand that after the time limit has been reached, no more tablet time until the next day.	USB-C Charging Cable
my granddaughter is enjoying it thoroughly. my son likes the various parental controls	iPhone
the child that this item was purchased for hasn't put it down. he is really enjoying it!	iPhone
excellent tablet for a young child that is very durable, expandable, inexpensive and my grand daughter loves it.	USB-C Charging Cable
this was a starter kindle for my grandson. since i already have a kindle fire tablet that i love, i had no hesitation buying this for someone else. i chose this tablet because of the childproof case and the extended replacement warranty since the gift was for an adolescent boy.	LG Dryer
the kids never put them down, plenty of apps to keep them interested. parental locks keep them safe.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great tablet for young children. parental locks so you can control what they see. a great deal of educational apps.	Lightning Charging Cable

my kids are 18 months and 4 and they love this tablet. it's easy for them to use and very lightweight	Wired Headphones
i bought two of these for christmas for my 3 and 4 year old and they love them! easy to navigate and it keeps them busy and interested for hours. sturdy protective bumper protector keeps your kids kindle safe. the only complaint i have is the charger doesn't stay snug and one is already useless because it won't fit tight enough to charge. this isn't a problem with this kindle but maybe all of them. i bought my oldest son a regular kindle fire the same day and his charger is worthless now too. not quite sure what the problem is with them.	Wired Headphones
thought this would be perfect for my two children. the case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. however, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccuratewhich can be frustrating for children. the case is a little too bulky. and it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. there is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users.	Lightning Charging Cable
we recently purchased this exact tablet for our daughter who is 2 years old and decided to purchase this tablet for a charitable gift at christmas. i would recommend this rather than more expensive tablet options for a child. it is worth the money and very user friendly.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
we recently purchased this as a gift for charity. we chose this because we purchased the same type tablet for our daughter and couldn't be more please. it's very easy set up and super user friendly. i would def. recommend this for a child rather than a more expensive product.

i bout this item for my granddaughter for christmas. it has games that she enjoys playing the case protects the device very well. it also can be set up for age appropriate games etc. as she gets older you can change that. it is bigger than an ipod and smaller than an ipad and has a better price. since it is a google device you can go there to get more apps	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my son is 5 is clumsy! hes had this tablet about a month as many times as hes dropped it still works perfect!	USB-C Charging Cable

AAA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased as a christmas gift for my grandson. he loved it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i looked at multiple other brands, some cheaper by 2040 bucks. this is the only one that guarantees your kid cant break it for 2 years! drinks have spilled on it, its been dropped, thrown sat on and not a thing wrong with it.	Lightning Charging Cable
sturdy construction, withstands toddlers use or abuse	Bose SoundSport Headphones

my girls love the tablet. it has lots of apps they can download. the only problem the battery is used up even when not in use.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the best tablet for a kids tablet. the modified android operating system with amazon features builtin is great. i am reviewing for what it is, a kids tablet. it has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. you wont run out of memory. it has a 2 megapixel camera that shoots in 720p, meaning not full 1080 hd or 4k. again, if you bought it for a camera you'd be wrong, but for a kid 2 years to 12 years old, that's good. it has 1 gig of ram so it is kind of sluggish on more detailed games. our 2 year old isn't playing any heavy graphics games that take up the cpu and gpu. it came with a nice rubber case for drop protection and she has thrown it a few times excitedly and it did its job. it has no resource hogging gps or radio but it does have bluetooth and wifi.	USB-C Charging Cable
excellent gift for my grandkids. they love it and play with it all the time.	Google Phone
proved to be an excellent christmas gift for both grandkids. they love it	Lightning Charging Cable
my son had a nabi we bought for learning entertainment. there were many games we downloaded that didnt work without internet or would shut down randomly on it. but we habe yet to encounter a problem with the fire! i download games and books for him to read which work just great without having to be connected to the internet.

i bought this tablet right after black friday. it had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. the included one year software freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. so far, we really like this tablet. the only thing that i still need time to determine its battery life. after about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50. very satisfied.

this tablet is perfect for kids under 12 years. it has lots of fun apps for the kids.	Google Phone
this tablet is perfect for a young child. the case it comes with is wonderful and seems very protective.	USB-C Charging Cable
i have two of these for my kids. ages 2 and 3. they are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. easy to setup and link to amazon account. only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. kids are less patient than adults you know. overall, well worth the money.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought the first kindle years ago for my sister. when my oldest turned 1, he wouldn't leave her kindle alone. we decided to buy him one he has had it ever since. the learning apps such as the counting ones, ones about learning shapes, and learning his abcs, assists in his advancement in his schooling. we all have a kindle in the house, to include my 3 year old this is his first year with one. love it!

i bought 2 amazon kid's fire tablets for my two grandsons for christmas. included in the purchase of the a.k.f. tablets is a one year subscription to kid's free time.i have called emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate begin using the free one year subscription of kid's free time, still no resolution.upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. i do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtainactivate a service that is included in the already prepaid purchase!i have been waiting for a response since christmas.therefore, at this time, i would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. with hope of getting this issue resolved i would still recommend to a friend.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a great tablet , lots of fun for the kids i reccomend big time.	iPhone
overall a good first tablet for a child. i find it difficult to find a specific game on the child user. the adult user has a search feature. not sure where the search feature is on the child user. my 5 yr old grandson is enjoying the tablet.	20in Monitor
was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. this was on sale and had good reviews. after consulting with the sales associate with some questions, i decided to purchase item. nice looking product, however, very little storage space. after downloading a few apps. the storage was full and was required to buy more! also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. unlike the sales associate told me. very disappointing! would not recommend!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.so, easy to handle for my toddler.with the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the tablett, it slows down in speed. that, for sure, i dislike. but over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great starter tablet. purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. my son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

your can really control what your kid gets access to from apps, videos, and the internet. you can not get a better deal. the 2 yr anything happens warranty is a big plus. it's not the fastest thing on the market it's desent. picture quality is great. everything that comes with it just makes it a real smart buy. love the fact that i can program it to have her read 15mins 1st before she can fully access it. also that i can put a time limit on what she can access and for how long for the week.

slow processor equates to slow internet browsing. user i nterface is ok. really wish it had the capability to lock onto the movie screen while my toddler watches movies. next time i'll just spend the additional money on an ipad mini for my kids.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. as of right now i need to return it to see if a new one will work. there are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. it will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. i am hoping a new one will not be faulty.

i got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but and this is on me for not researching but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still.now reason why i'm about to return them! you cannot get youtube kids at all! no google apps. you can get some youtube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. they're full of commercials.so i wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an ipad but this is a deal breaker for me.

amazon's devices get better and better each release. i've had the original kindle fire and it's in no way an apple ipad replacement, but what it does it does better than anyone. it's a perfect starter tablet and perfect for a child. the price keeps you from worrying about drops and the interface is easy to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased two of these tablets, one for my niece, one for my nephew, as they are often fighting over the tablet. it is a great platform, with awesome apps, and comes equipped with a very sturdy and rugged case. five stars. worth every penny.	Lightning Charging Cable

bought this for my daughter3 and she can't even use it because it is not kid friendly. it is so incredibly slow! it freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. also was supposed to come with a year free of amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month ! it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. keep calling amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. don't buy!	27in FHD Monitor

i bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. they had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the ipad since they stole mine all the time. lol. that made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. besides that, it's a good product.

very easy for a child to be able to use and enjoy.	Wired Headphones
bought for my kid 5 year old kid. worth a buy. recommended.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
in a field full of options, the fire kids edition really comes among one of the top contenders. great parental controls and great array of downloadable content makes this a great stepping stone into the world of tablets for kids. i see reviews that list battery life as a con, but at over six hrs. and for the price, what more do you need. i'm buying this for my fouryear old and i'm not planning on her being on the tablet for six hours, let alone 8 or 9, which is what bigger tablets can handle. if you have older kids, perhaps you may want to consider a bigger, more powerful tablet. for the preschool crowd, this is just a great tablet for both learning and entertaining.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

my 5 year old grandson really enjoys his new tablet. he's had it for several months. the only negative i see is the charge port is starting to get loose. the small plug is maybe not robust enough for a 5 year old.	27in FHD Monitor

great for kids. my grandson 5 years is very happy with it	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the idea is great, a kindle just for kids. design just for them with preapproved content.the price was great. i got it for 79.99 on black friday. plus, it has a 2 year full replacement warranty. they break it, we fix it. is that simple.content, wow tons of apps, interactive books and videos.user interface, not the best one. amazon should create a computer base aplication to enable and edit all content.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought one of these for each of my grandkids and they love it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

my special needs 8 yr old has gone through two ipads at 200.00 each. the amazon fire kids edition is such a better option. it is loaded with thousands of appropriate options for games and movies without having to download or pay for individual apps. i can even use it in adult mode. i'm very happy with this purchase and highly highly recommend it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
young kids love it, easy to use and takes a beating but still cheap enough that if it does happen to break you don't break the bank too	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a ipad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this tablet for my 5year old son, and it's an amazing tablet. it has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. i am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. for anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the amazon play on the adult user side, go into settings and select share for the movie you want your child to have on their side. it's great if your child needs a tablet but you don't want them to have access to the internet or run up cellular charges on games.	Lightning Charging Cable
when i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. its fill with tons of bloat wear. the opening screen has about 15 20 apps. it worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.	USB-C Charging Cable
when used with amazon prime and the ""freetime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. installed a 64 gb micro sd and install as many apps to the card as possible to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. easy enough to use for our 5 year old granddaughter.	USB-C Charging Cable
when used with amazon prime and the ""freetime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. recommend installing at least 32 gb of micro sd card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. easy enough to use for our 2 year old grandson.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased 2 of these as christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. we decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for christmas day. after opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an amazon account and credit or gift card. i had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. there may be some way around this restriction, but i didn't find it.	Vareebadd Phone
bought this as a gift so i don't know much about it. seems nice though	Wired Headphones
i'm a father of two. both of my kids 6 10 got ipads last year for christmas and love them, but i felt the ipad was lacking a little of what they really need. purchased two of these and couldn't be more happier. perfect kids tablet. don't make the mistake i did and go with the ipad. this product nails it in every aspect the ipad wasn't in terms of a ""kids"" tablet	Lightning Charging Cable
durable case, easy to use. my grandkids watch nursery rhymes and play educational games. i've seen the youngest stand on the fire and it is still perfect	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i read the reviews before purchasing this so i went into it knowing there will be apps preloaded that i will have to remove. that being said, i purchased this for my 7yo daughter and it is perfect for the purpose considering it includes the case and nohassle protection guarantee.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my daughters first tab,i love that it has protected case and parental controls my son will be jealous because it has more memory than his	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i would would not recommend this for a child. it's not kid friendly at all. i have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. i think this product is is a better fit for adults.	27in FHD Monitor
great tablet for the price. add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.	Wired Headphones

good value for the price and for the children. the apps are enough to let them play and read.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i really liked the many facets of the tablet. presence of alexa does provide opportunity for adults to play and surprise by it.the only caveat is amazon free time is for only 1 year which amazon should increase by atleast 1 year for prime members but thats more of service and no complains on tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
it's a great tablet for a destructive 10 year old. it's still going strong for 2 months now	ThinkPad Laptop

the amazon free time is very kid friendly. my 2 year old uses it with ease. tons of kid apps for all ages	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a great tablet for kids as it is not too expensive and there is a 2 year warranty. if it breaks within 2 years, they replace it. my 4 year is very rough with things. my husband was letting him plug the charger in by himself and jammed it into the tablet, causing the charging port to break. i had no problems getting it replaced.

nice tablet the colors and visuals are great and the many downloaded and downloadable apps that come with it are terrific. something for all ages and very simple my niece and nephew are 5 and 4 and they are finding it very easy to use. the hard rubber cover is a great extra i had to buy a cover for the last tablet and it cost over 30 for something that sturdy and protective. excellent product.	27in FHD Monitor
my grandson used my old i phone to play on. got him this tablet and he loves it! great deal!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
got this for my 7 year old daughter, she loves it. we read on it, she plays on it, there are videos on it, and she can't or hasn't found a way to break it yet. well done amazon, well done.	USB-C Charging Cable
very sturdy for little people who might drop it easy to read	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i am so delighted i purchased this tablet for my toddler son! pros the rubber case allows the tablet to take quite a beating, which was crucial for this purchase. another huge pro is that adults can use the tablet under their own signon which works like any other tablet. from the adult signon you can customize what your kids can watch, screen time allowance, and add or remove apps for them. the price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsconskind of bummed i can't link my google play apps i purchased but i guess it makes sense this is not a googleandroid product. the battery life isn't all that great, but the charger is fast!i wish there was a freeze option that would prevent kids from hitting the screen while watching netflix or other videos highly recommend for anyone with young children. you won't be disappointed!

the tablet itself works fine but this is the 2nd one i have gotten with a similar problem. the port seems to come defected. the charger doesn't stay in and it takes a long time to charge. replaced charger with a brand new one and it still has issues.	Lightning Charging Cable
got this for my 8yo daughter. a lot of the times it doesn't work, i have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that i added on it. it came with way too many preloaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her inside out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my ipad.

this item is not good ok .no use for my kids ,,,	AA Batteries (4-pack)
these kindle tablets are beginning to get pretty cheap. especially when the other kids tablets are relatively close in pricing. nothing has gone wrong with this kindle as of now, and our niece has been enjoying it. a kids account and adult account is made. the kids accounts has access to whatever the adults account allows. this is pretty standard in kids tablets, but this one handles it well. it makes it much easier.	27in FHD Monitor
i was completely under the impression that this tablet was child friendly but there are no built in restrictions so my son was able to purchase numerous apps and movies. my son usually uses my wife's ipad so i thought this tablet would be a good replacement but the interface is geared towards adults not a young child. if you buy this tablet, immediately change the settings to require a pin to make purchases.i think the age recommendation should be 5 not 3.

this is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. my problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com. that is the hardware supports audible. in order for my child to use audible i had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader. i was sad because there are lots of great family features that i had to disable.i did not use geek squad, i reached out directly to kindle support. presales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. i had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features . even then, i could not disable the alexa app. my child has full access to alexa and the rights to turn on shopping. kind of scary.so my disappointment is that amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability.

this tablet is great for kids. it has so many apps and videos that can be downloaded. it has a nice size screen as well. the only thing i don't like is the charger.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i bought this tablet for my son so he could have something to entertain him on our road trips. it works great. i love the childproof case that it comes with. my only complaint is that the interface is slow sometimes. i'm honestly not surprised though, because it runs off of android. i typically avoid android but i figured i would give it a shot. after using this tablet, i think i will avoid using android products again. besides the slowness of the android os, it is still a great tablet.	20in Monitor

i purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in februarymarch i believe and have had 1 replaced. not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. the only issue i have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. other than that i love them and my boys love them.

the fire kid edition 7 is good but not great. volume is pretty low. but my son throws it around and it doesn't break. case is stone hard. i also the the brightness on the screen can be a bit low.	Lightning Charging Cable
after buying this tablet for my grandchildren i was going through the initial setup procedure.that's where i was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year i would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs i used for a year.time to take it back to the store. no hidden fees.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on	AA Batteries (4-pack)

super slow, not of decent quality.i would not buy another. memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. i will not recommend it to anyone	Wired Headphones
my daughter can't get enough of this tablet. the only thing i would suggest that you have youtube kids as a pre installed app. the adds are ridiculous for children when you download it from the app store.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my 4yo loves this. he can maneuver it easily to go from different games and videos. stays charged a long time.	27in FHD Monitor
parental controls are key. my boys can download games within the parameters i set and i get notification of any purchases. 2 year no questions asked replacement is key.	USB-C Charging Cable

you have the ability to set up on and off times for your child's profile. the apps are good and adults can use it as well, because you can have multiple password protected profiles on the tablet at once. this was perfect for my five year old on a five thousand mile plus plane trip.

we bought the kindle fire to replace a broken ipad 2, which was now out of date for any further updates. i love the parental controls. the case has been a savior for a few drops. my daughter loves the size of the tablet. the 2 year replacement plan and 1 year unlimited freespace makes this the perfect tablet for my child. she loves that she doesn't have to ask everytime she wants a new game or video. we chose to expand the memory up to 128gb with a microsd and so no worries about running out of storage space! my only complaint is that the battery life isn't anywhere near the power of an ipad. so keep your charger with you!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

great tablet for the girls, they love it. easy to use and great with amazon prime.	Vareebadd Phone
my two year old learned how to operate my smart phone so i decided to get her a tablet. after looking at various toy and educational versions, this seemed like the best choice. the preloaded apps are fun and educational. the ability to set daily time limits is great as i didn't want this to becoming a replacement for playing outside or an instant babysitter. also the ability to switch profiles and operate like any other kindle fire is nice for when my wife wants to read. great deal with a good manufacturer warranty. very pleased with it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i didn't want to buy my 8 year old something really expensive but i wanted a good device so i tried this out and she loves it. the case that comes with it makes it almost indestructible.	20in Monitor

love the idea of it. not as easy to put the dvd movies on it .	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is a good tablet for kids and comes with a good warranty	Apple Airpods Headphones
was thinking of getting my 5 year old her own ipad or the kindle. i'm so glad that i picked the kindle, it comes with a kids version of her own log in and is so easy for her to find appropriate games, movies, and apps, even though she can't read yet. she loves it too!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
my kids love the kids fire they use it every single day. its durable. i can put parental control on certain things. great buy	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i purchased 2 others for my 5 6yrolds, and my 3yrold niece enjoyed playing theirs so much i then bought this one for her. the included 1yr subscription to freetime is awsome for the kids! parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.the lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out all the time! very frustrating!	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my 6yrold am impressed wthe 1yr subscription to freetime that was included, and the additional 2yr manufacturer warranty. the actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. also think included apps are helpful. really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. the reason i didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!	Wired Headphones
my kids really seem to like this. i really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.	20in Monitor
i bought this tablet for my granddaughter. she loves it, it's easy for her to use, and just right for her size.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bough this for my daughter and it's perfect for her little tiny hands, i just wish that the screen would lock when she is watching her shows because she gets excited and touches the screen and it pauses or chances the show or it goes to other apps. overall it's a great product for a small child	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
my daughter loves her tablet. i couldn't have made a better purchase.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the third kindle fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. i absolutely love this thing. it's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. my 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different moviesgames. setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on charactersthemes appropriate for their age group. moving our disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. the battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. the biggest complaint is that the micro usb connection isn't the best. the cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. i've seen this problem with other kindles as well. this is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. it also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. the amazing amount of content that you get from the amazon library with the included year is nice as well. my 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that i otherwise wouldn't let him try since i'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. overall, i'd say the best kid tablet out there.	Wired Headphones
i love that the kids can only do what you allow them to they can't get to the internet unless you put it on there profile which i don't because i have a four and 2 year old, there apps are very easily accessed and are big so they can b seen very well . also these tablets double and can b used as a regular tablet for grown ups	Wired Headphones
there is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. the biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that i have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. this means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an ipad can do with guided access activated.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased for my niece and she loves it. i like the fact i can set limits on her tablet and restrict her access until she has read. only downside is the case doesn't have a kickstand so that the tablet can be placed upright for viewing videosmovies. but a new case can be purchased.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
my grandson is very happy with his kindle. the case protects it very well.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is the best purchase i've mad in a tablet my daughter loves it	Wired Headphones

my 5 year old dropped this from a standing position about a foot off the ground and it busted. i had to use the bb warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. i'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids.

my grand baby is two years old and she absolutely loves it!	Lightning Charging Cable
my kids enjoy this tablet, as do i! the only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much, even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in be.also uses a ton of memory, even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken.	20in Monitor
got this for my daughter 2nd birthday and she absolutely love it.	Lightning Charging Cable

our children tend to forget to get gentle with the kindle so the replacement plan is great. and i don't have to worry about the wrong kind of content popping up. it's a relief.	Wired Headphones
i like the covered protection it has and also it comes with 2 years replacement so no need to worry. it has fire os so apps won't be much but there are enough apps for kids .	Lightning Charging Cable
we got this tablet for our toddler. the setup was going great. installed all the apps from amazon and transferred them to his account. then we went to load netflix for him. to say it's been frustrating with the netflix app is an understatement. we had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. netflix does not work well with this tablet. it either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. it takes several attempts to get netflix to load but then it works. that's the only complaint. other then that it's great.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my daughter who is two loves it. she colors and dose puzzles	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
serves its purpose for the price. would much rather have the ipad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i bought this for my daughter to use. i know the regular amazon fire is cheaper, but this one came with a bumper, a two year no question warranty and a one year subscription to free time which allows kids to read lot of books and play great games for free. in the end it's a great deal.

my grandkids love it. they use it at home and when we travel.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after christmas, best buy was out of stock. we thought this was a good alternative she gets from her grandparents, so it was her purchase since she broke her old tablet as well. due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. we also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. it was really easy to set this up i wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. so, yes i had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. so far, a great buy!	Lightning Charging Cable
bought this tablet for my 2 12 year old and it is perfect. games and videos that come on it are very age appropriate and the tablet has been very durable thus far.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
we bought this for our 3 year old daughter. great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. my only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3year old i can't complain too much.

my other daughter has this same tablet, so i knew it would be a winner with my other child as well.	Wired Headphones
pros liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. cons one grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. was hoping i could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. would recommend this only for very young children.	iPhone

so my 18 month old maybe the future computer wizard because she everything about my tablet. however my biggest concern is not so much that she knows how to unlock my ipad, but throwing it down the stairs like one of her toys. which makes the kindle fire tablet for kids the best invention since the tivo. all the pre loaded apps, videos, books, etc is nothing short of amazing. the case is also very cool, hardwood floor and stair case proof. for under 100 bucks this is perfect for tech savvy kids like mine.

perfect for price and purpose. i bought this for my 19 month old granddaughter to watch videos and listen to songs on instead of using parents iphone. when she is older she will be able to play games. perfect size for her to hold. love guarantee	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i love this solutions for my kids. i gave it a four star rating because in order to install apps you just have to tap the icon. well my two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a kangaroo on a pogo stick. needless to say the ran out of room quickly. i tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. i especially like the parental control features. i just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed.	USB-C Charging Cable
this tablet has so many apps with games, movies, and books that it keeps my nephew entertained for hours on end.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. i have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.	Flatscreen TV
the tablet is great with many build in games. the only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's nice but not as easy to switch profiles as i would like for it being a child's tablet. but overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile.	Wired Headphones
i love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise i'd give it 5 stars. the pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands.	USB-C Charging Cable
my son is constantly distracted and loves technology. him being only two years old, this proved to be the perfect thing to keep him occupied and out of trouble.	iPhone

i've never had a tablet other than an apple. it seems to charge quite slow but i'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting i'm not aware of but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that i am very happy since it's for my son.	USB-C Charging Cable

i bought this for my daughter. it was bundled with a solid bumper case and has a kid mode interface. she insisted on using her brother's ipad constantly. not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her.	Wired Headphones
this is the second one i bought. my older son wouldn't share his so for christmas santa brought little brother one lol. the apps that come with the subscription are endless. i also have netflix and both kids watch different shows on it too. i once bought a sprout cubby tablet and it broke within 2 days and the customer service was terrible they would not replace and actually wanted to charge more than i paid. the customer service with amazon however is fantastic and replaced my sons tablet when it cracked within 3 days! they are durable but my older toddler is just a crazy lil man. you won't regret buying this for your kids.	27in FHD Monitor
the product is really crafted for kids n they just glue to it as it offers an array of rich topics, apps, etc	AA Batteries (4-pack)

after reading the reviews and also seeing in the description that this has a 2 year unconditional warranty we were sold. our child loves this tablet and he's dropped it many times with no damage. the thick padded case really does work wonders for this.	USB-C Charging Cable

my 3 year old grand child is loving this tablet. she is really catching on to using technology . she loves this and plays a lot of educational things that was available to her.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the price for this tablet is not the only great selling point. the free year of amazon free time is perfect for my son. there are tons of games, books, and videos in this service. my favorite feature is how we can set time limits on screen time. we can even set it to require an amount of learning app or book time per day before access to games is allowed. great choice for kids.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i have a 3 year old at home. best purchase ever! indestructible. reliable. easy to program. i would highly recommend this.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the kindle fire is great especially the kid version. the free time app keeps the kids out of my files and prevents them from messing with tablet settings.	USB-C Charging Cable

year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. won't power up. when it was working, very limited on storage. ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
a good choice for younger children. i bought for a 4 year old to replace a nabi. however it doesn't have as many app choices as an android device	Apple Airpods Headphones
nice tablet for my one year old daughter.however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.	27in FHD Monitor
i baught 2 for my kids, and figured that with the cover the the one year of freetime which includes all the videos, apps and games then it makes sense. i baught this one as a gift for a kid overseas, and all the content is not playing, when i contacted amazon, they said it's not for overseas, although i asked in best buy before i buy it and they assured me it works everywhere. it's totally overpriced for a tablet that doesn't play anything! best buy should know and let customers know specially when u ask specifically!	20in Monitor
this is just what we needed for a you k8d .the apps are great	Apple Airpods Headphones
gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera	USB-C Charging Cable

grandson loves his new tablet. had to set him up as an adult because amazon had too many restrictions for child account	Apple Airpods Headphones
right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. it's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is the second tablet i've purchased aimed for little ones and it's by far the best. easy to access his games and plenty of preloaded games, videos and apps. it makes road trips so much happier!	Flatscreen TV
really like this pretty easy to set up i love the bumper also the free time settings when time is up that's that and no figthing with mom. i thought i saw something stating that the free time feature is only free for one year so rating may change if i find this to be true. would hate to be charged for what the kindle was intended for.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my niece loves this tablet! she will not put it down!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

tablet is so user friendly and a price you can not beat	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for my 8 year olds birthday. it is perfect and all 4 kids have their own profile so there is no fighting. the parental controls are awesome, we set daily limits for them, but then they want to share with each other when one is done with their time. we love it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. i have to limit his use. lots of appsgames that incorporate learning. very age appropriate and safe. no worries on what my child is being exposed to.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.	Lightning Charging Cable
my 2 year old son really enjoys the tablet it's great	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a huge hit as a gift for my 3 year old daughter.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great tablet for kids. it has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. there are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read.	Lightning Charging Cable
the tablet is pretty good, i would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the google store, that is one of my only big complaint. and also how fast the sd card got filled with items from amazon os that's on the tablet without the user knowing. on the other hand, with four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful	Macbook Pro Laptop
bought this for my 3 year old and it is great. wish it had a bit more storage but overall very happy with my purchase.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
piece of mind that the little one won't wonder the world wide web and be exposed to things no parent wants to have to explain!	USB-C Charging Cable
this was a gift to my niece. her mom liked the parental controls	USB-C Charging Cable
my child loves this device. she doesn't stop playing with it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is an awesome tablet for kids. love the versatility. this is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. the charger is horrible though. does not charge well at all. returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. after the second had problems charging, i tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. then we bought this one. same problem. the charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. all 3 tablets had the same issue. i have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. so in summary, the tablet is aweosme. the charger is awful.	Wired Headphones
good tablet for kids. easy to use and kid friendly	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i'm very happy with this tablet.my nephew loves it.	Lightning Charging Cable

it's a great beginner tablet for kids allows you to ensure your kids are viewing and playing contents for their age.	Lightning Charging Cable
my granddaughter loves her tablet toddler friendly	Lightning Charging Cable
my wife purchased this for my daughter , great for learning to read.	Wired Headphones
battery life isn't great, but overall for what i paid it is a good tablet for my kids. i did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when i returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being elite plus and being under 45 days. that aside it's a good tablet, but i was very disappointed in the customer service issue.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with kindle freetime which is almost 80 on it's own. it's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. our first unit had an issue after updating the os, but amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. i would have gone through best buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. i would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons my older kids 3 year old kindle fire hds don't have a camera or microphone. allinall, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them.	USB-C Charging Cable
i needed something for a young kid and this tablet was suggested to me from a sales person at best buy. the kid loves it.	Wired Headphones

great idea for a 5 years old. very secure and good contents for that age.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this device is a nice starter tablet for kids. the fire os with freetime unlimited free for 1 year is an excellent environment. the warranty is great, and had we kept the device i'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. however, the device we received in the ""kids edition"" box was not registered as a ""kids edition"" with amazon, thus the freetimeunlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""kids edition"" warranty did not apply. amazon could not register the fire as a ""kids edition"" so it was returned.	20in Monitor
very rugged design. my nieces absolutely love this.	Macbook Pro Laptop
easy for my kid to use and navigate through. fun for adults too.	Apple Airpods Headphones
very easy to use for our seven year old. will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. she had an ipad lost it and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. seems durable thus far.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my 6 year old neice for christmas. she loves it. no issues this far. charges fast and has child lock features.	Macbook Pro Laptop

great that you can add micro sd card for expanded memory. works great for around the house and long trips. battery lasts a good amount of time and no issues with quality.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is perfect for young children and comes ready to use straight out of the box. the case is very well built to protect the tablet and the device is actually pretty light and easy to hold. once you sign in with your 'parent' account, you can set up your child's profile and it's ready to go. easy to navigate menus with great parental controls this tablet truly delivers safe content and games for hours of enjoyment. the key is to load new content while you have access to wifi so the books, games and videos are available while traveling.

he loves his new tablet lots of fun and educational games to choose from and best of all very kid proof he has dropped it numerous times and i see no signs of damage whatsoever	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but i'm not sure i'd want it as an adult. there are much better tablets on the market. but since it's cheap, that's to be expected.	27in FHD Monitor
great for the child. unfortunately it doesn't have a volume limit setting	Vareebadd Phone
great hardware for the price, similar to the ipads	AA Batteries (4-pack)

this is excellent for kids 37. the only thing i don't like is it is difficult to go to kids web pages by typing in an web address once you set up the kids profile, plus it takes away the easy access of the camera which the kids love. i may have set it up wrong as it did not come with printed instructions and i am not tech savvy. this item is extremely durable and great fun for the kids.

bought this for my 4yo daughter for christmas and it's a sturdy little unit. it survived falls and drops but the one weak spot is the usb power plug, somehow my daughter managed to break it. however this is where amazon stepped up as the tablet's warranty calls for amazon to replace if damaged. i called customer service, they took my info and i had a brand new tablet deliver the next day!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my daughter for christmas. she loves it	Google Phone
this tablet is ok, sometimes it's kind of slow. loads for a while before opening app. storage has been good. 32 gb. i gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. and after 2 months he still has like 3gb left of space. not recommend for kids over 10 years old. my son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primetime for 80	AA Batteries (4-pack)
awesome tablet for young children. they love to play all the videos that it came equipped with already on it.	USB-C Charging Cable
my wife and i wanted our children to still enjoy the feeling of having an ""ipad"", so we got the amazon fire kids edition. it has been awesome. i love the way you can set limits on the tablet so they're not glued to it all day long. kids mode is extremely beneficial.	USB-C Charging Cable

purchase it for my granddaughter and she love it many great children's app for learning	Wired Headphones
the tablet is great and i like the warranty that it comes with, but i don't like the charging port. the wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. we bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. on one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug.	USB-C Charging Cable
kindle fire is extremely easy to use. the protective foam layer is awesome.	Vareebadd Phone
i bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! it has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
not just for the kids, for the tablet challenged me i find it easy to work with	Lightning Charging Cable

i have purchased 3 of these tables still have them just handed them down one grandchild to the next will need another next year. they are tough the heavy rubber case really keeps them safe. good product!	iPhone
my 4 year old grandson enjoys 'playing' with his tablet. i say playing because he thinks most of the programs on it are games that he can play. at some point he will probably realize that while enjoying the games he is also learning. he enjoys it a lot!	USB-C Charging Cable
we got this product for our 6 year old. i love the parental controls. only downfalls i've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. wise on the parent login on this product.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought it xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iphones to watch utube videos. it's cool looking and well made plus alexa is helpful. it she still prefers our iphones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. i like it but don't live it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. they'll be on a game or show and accidentally.or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. it needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. the first one broke and i couldn't tell you how it happened. i think i had two of press down on it or something because i had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. since then i haven't had any issue with the new one	Vareebadd Phone
i definitely recommend this tablet is so perfect for children.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this has been awesome. for my. 5 year old nephew. keeps him entertained and it works great.	Wired Headphones

reviews were quite on spot with this product,very easy setup and very easy to use	Lightning Charging Cable
my kids watch movies in the car, i link in with my mobile device and share my unlimited internet with both tablets. i have set up hulu netflix on both accounts and they have tons of hrs of movies and shows. amaxzon also gives you a 1 year subscription to games. and worry free 2 years replacement guarantee!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter so that she would have something to play games and read books without having to use her mom's devices. she took to it immediately. it connects easily to a 2.4 ghz network but does not support connectivity to a 5 search and downloads did appear a bit slow but did not do testing to see if it was the fire or the network, then again, it was running updates. the camera takes great pictures even if a child is a bit shakey. sound quality is very good as is touch sensitivity.	Wired Headphones
my 3 yr old son loves his tablet. he takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great tablet for kids, the protective bumper pad really does help. the unlimited warranty gives piece of mind as with kids anything will break. finally the 1 yr unlimited warranty to amazon for shows and movies the kids can watch. awesome deal for the price.	iPhone

i got this tablet for my 3 year old granddaughter. she enjoys it and it keeps her busy and learning. everything rolled into one for her.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this table is good for children because won't break if dropped. however, the only problem i have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use.	Vareebadd Phone
where do i begin? it comes with an amazing thick case, it's a fully functioning tablet. it also comes with a one year subscription to educational games and movies shows. if it breaks amazon replaces! how could you choose any other tablet? this was so great we had to get two!	USB-C Charging Cable
this device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.	20in Monitor
the only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for amazon	Lightning Charging Cable
leapfrog is a great learning tool for preschoolers and beyond my grandson loves it	AA Batteries (4-pack)
works as described. love the kid friendly foam protector. it stopped working within 2 months of purchase. amazon just sent new one without a real fuss. inconvenient, but no real fuss. i hope this one lasts longer.	27in FHD Monitor
my daughter love it and is amazing thanks and i will recommend it	Lightning Charging Cable
this was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. the reason i didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. they need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet is great for kids my grandson is sick and he absolutely loves it	Flatscreen TV
we brought this tablet for our 6 yr old for xmas and she loves it!. it was the go to tablet as she was always playing on my fire tablet. recommend for kids	Lightning Charging Cable

a good starter tablet, but very very slow. don't expect and i pad savy child to enjoy this. but for a true beginner it would be fine.	Lightning Charging Cable
my 4 year old love to watch movies and this is perfect for him!	Apple Airpods Headphones
we purchased this for our 3 year grandson for christmas and he just fell in love with it. great learning tool to start kids off with!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this tablet as a christmas gift for my granddaughter who just started kindergarten and it is helping her tremendously with her basic skills in counting and reading in english and foreign languages. she also enjoys having the tablet to read stories to her as it lights up the words for her to read along. she loves the ability to watch her favorite programs as well. this was most definitely a worthwhile purchase.	Lightning Charging Cable
i researched other tablets before purchasing the amazon fire kids edition. this tablet is everything i thought it would be and more. great price too. lots of available features and apps. very easy to use. my 2 year old grandson loves it! he' s having lots of fun and learning.	Google Phone
my grandkids love to use it. it has so much for them to choose and they learn too.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! i witnessed her drop it once off the couch to laminate floor nothing i can tell was affected. i was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, i just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times .not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! i can set the tablet so when my older kids 10 and 8 log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play. and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so i don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night great tablet, glad i got the bumper too, great price	Macbook Pro Laptop
boy! if i had something like this when i was a kid. the learning devices these kids have today. makes learning about different things in around the world a fun experience. all the other activities downloadable apps, they can be on it for hours. like it!	iPhone
kids love their kindles! amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. they love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. the only reason i give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. they are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. otherwise, kindle kids is amazing!	Lightning Charging Cable
the guy at the store was really helpful. there was not a pink fire kids edition so he looked on top of all the shelves and found one. my four year old grand daughter loves it.	USB-C Charging Cable
good for smaller kids that cannot play or get to play on xbox games with 7 other siblings	Apple Airpods Headphones

great, nonexpensive item for my kids to us and not destroy my ipad.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this for my 3 year old granddaughter after having purchased her older sister one last year when she was 3. it's comforting knowing it has as durable cover to endure the energy of a toddler.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my daughter. it's a little limited in what it can do, but she loves it. she's a little too young to understand the games, but she loves watching cartoons on it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

my child loves her tablet and i love it. it keeps her busy with learning games and books	Google Phone
i love that you can read books as well as play games with this tablet. i bought 2 of them for my little boy and girl. we just charge them up and let them play with them in the car on road trips. they are quite! the only thing is, i wish they would have a section of games that can be played without wifi. some of the apps need wifi to run and some do not. overall though, i love this tablet!	Wired Headphones
this tablet is great. because it's from amazon, you can easily switch to a different profile and use it when the kids finally put it down. i have 2 12 year old twins and it's hard to get them to sit down. with the kid's kindle fire, they are more than happy to settle down on the couch and play. i highly recommend buying one. it is a life saver!	20in Monitor
this has been a wonderful tablet for our 9 year old son. i was able to set reading achievements that he must complete before he can play his games or watch videos. i like how you can secure it and adjust the setting to what we find appropriate for our child.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
kid proof! bought for my grand babies and they love it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good quality little tablet, great for kids. locked down and does not run full android so you cannot use google play store apps.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it's a good tablet for kids the only thing i really don't like is the fact that you need to put in a credit card to be able to get apps but other than that is ok	Apple Airpods Headphones
searched around for the perfect tablet for my 3 year old. after testing tablets in stores and reading reviews online the kids fire stood out. the 2 year warranty and free year access to kids content is amazing. the soft foam case provides coverage for drops, the battery life is good for a few hours of play time and the charge time is quick after. for the money this tablet cannot be beat , only minor issue ive noticed is having connection issue with networks at times but this is can be fixed by disconcerting and reconnecting to network. overall this is a best buy for the money, tablet can also be used for adults when you exit the free time app.	Apple Airpods Headphones
give this product a 10 tons of great learning programs.	27in FHD Monitor
they learned how to use it very quickly! great for travelling in the car.reduces boredom!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my granddaughter loves this tablet. she is two and has no problem playing the games and using this tablet. it's very user friendly and keeps her busy for hours.	Flatscreen TV
great generic tablet for looking to keep kids occupied. mine enjoy the freetime unlimited, and the child restrictions are great for my needs.my only concern has been for the space available. i was amazed at how quickly they ate up 32 gb of space on apps.	USB-C Charging Cable
i didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of amazon was really confusing.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
used this on a trip from sf to maui for my 4 year old. she loved it. perfectly suited for a toddler.	USB-C Charging Cable
this tablet is a nice budget friendly device that is also rugged. it has survived countless falls from my 3 yr old. he loves it and it keeps him learning for hours.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
we love this tablet for our 2 year old. she can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. we love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this was the perfect gift for my grand kids they love it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. the memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and i was okay with that.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my two daughters really enjoy using their fire tablet. it is really easy to use, sturdy, high definition, has tons of awesome apps integrated for children. my girls were apple users, yet it was easy to transition.	USB-C Charging Cable
maybe i had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, i've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, i am even not longer using it it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment. i will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product	USB-C Charging Cable
when this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours no exaggerating is a bit much. we have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. my niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this thing is pretty cool. my nephew is pretty rough on this thing and it holds up. nice job on the heavy duty case. it is a little slow though.	iPhone
love this for my youngest. he had a nabi, but it just wasn't as user friendly as this is.	iPhone
we purchased 4 of these for our grandkids aged 18 months to 6 yrs and all 4 of them love them. they play with them daily for as long as their parental limits allow. they are very durable and come with a very kid durable skin. the 2 year warranty that covers everything was the selling part for us. the one con is that you don't get google play store.

purchased for 4 yr old, he loves it the fact he can play games or movies, love the parental controls as i am able to monitor how much he is on it.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bought these for my 5yr old twin grandkids and the enjoy the learning games so much. love that you can limit how long child is engaged with apps, games, or movies on this and that my daughter can use her amazon prime acct with this! 2yr amazon warranty is amazing as well	USB-C Charging Cable

thought this came without special offers, the staff told me it didn't. amazon had a sale on this when i bought it, and i thought i was just getting the same deal, but i had to pay 20 later to get rid of the ads	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the second kindle i've purchased, and i love my kindle! what i don't like is that every time a device is ""upgraded,"" the upgrades are annoying. on this kindle, the ""home"" page is changed it lists my reading list and my library. so you have to press my library to choose a new book. then it's a list of the books. why couldn't they just leave the home page showing the small pictures of the books you bought? i have no idea what my reading list is it lists books i've never heard of, by authors and topics of which i have no interest. still, i would recommend a kindle to anyone who reads books. the screen is easy to read, you can make the fonts bigger or smaller. i don't feel the battery lasts any longer than my old one did, but it's easy to charge. it's thin and lightweight, and i pretty much carry my kindle wherever i go. anyone who buys a kindle will definitely not be disappointed!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is the best of all kindles affordable and easier to read. the backlight option is good to read in dark.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i purchased this as a gift for a family member. she recently used this on a week long vacation and enjoyed the long batter life during the plane trip. the reader was also easy to read in the sun while at the beach.	Wired Headphones
i have several kindle versions. my daughter bought this for her birthday as she loves reading several series. she doesn't have to carry a bag full of bulky books on trips or use a light to read at night. it stores many books in a very small space and if she wants to reread a book she can simply go to her account and download it again if it's not on her kindle. the battery lasts a long time too. she now takes it to school to read during down time. i took mine on a 2 week trip to the galapagos. i used on in the airport, on my flights, and several times every day since there was no internet or tv on my ship. it took up very little space and weight on a restricted baggage limit and i didn't have to recharge it. also, it's much easier to hold vs a big book.

i love the kindle paperwhite as i can read it indoors and outdoors with no glare issues. i'm able to download books as needed very quickly. keeps me updated in my reading library.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

for a reading device, you cannot do better than kindle. and, if you're going to get a kindle, get the paperwhite as the lights on the screen are worth the extra cost over the base model. you will not regret it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i've been a kindle user since the very first one came out to the market and i always wanted to be able to use touch to communicate with the device. this kindle allows me to do just that.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i love this thing and bring it with me everywhere. my only problem is the backlight, hear me out i suggest this if your a serious reader. the problem is that reading a glowing page is off putting and one of the reasons i bought a paper white 3. becuase i can't read on a ipad for but maybe 20 mins. but its not that bad i usually just turn it off becuase most of my reading is done in daylight. all in all great but not perfect. and if your into occult reads like i am be ready to fork out the for them. the selection does leave some to be desired but not bad. i give the kindle store for books a 3 out of 5. if your not a serious reader3 books a week imo i i would go with a voyage or if you can stick to the ipad i would do that.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i started with a very old original kindle. amd have been debating for. well months if i should upgrade. i kept putting it off. my husband tells me i was dropping subtle hints all the time and he finally decided to pick it up for me and surprise me with it! i was at first a little put off with the rather high price but honestly once i started reading and playing with it. it is definitely worth it! this version more than the 200 one fits my style and in my opinion is better than the pricier one. you won't be disappointed!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the resolution and contrast are great, and unlike multiuse tablets, this performs great in direct sunlight. with the adjustable light, it's also great for pitchblack rooms. the battery life is also better than any tablet you'll find. i can't imagine going back to paper books ever again, not only because of the convenience of the kindle, but kindle books are always cheaper than their physical counterparts! i love this thing.

great alternative to an internet connectedgaming tablet for a reading device for kids to use in bed at night.	Apple Airpods Headphones

this is the newest kindle with improved resolution. fantastic device for the beach or any outdoor reading.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is my first kindle purchase, and i couldn't be happier with it. before i bought it i was very concerned that it would be too small for me to enjoy reading on, but my concern was soon expunged. i have always read books, then as i grew older and my eye sight grew worse, i moved to reading on my ipad air because i could increase the size of the print. the downside to my ipad though, was that it would get heavy to hold as i read, and after a while i would get some eye strain from the light being projected out from the device, even in night mode to a point, even though that was much better. so i decided to try the kindle paperwhite with the new 300 ppi type. i couldn't be happier with it. it's light to hold, even in one hand, which i do a lot, i can still adjust the type size to what i want, the type is very crisp and easy to read, and i find that i don't get the eye strain that i used to. one other benefit to the kindle is that reading outside is even better than reading inside, which can not be said for the ipad.another benefit to the kindle is that if i still feel like reading the book for a while on my ipad, using the free kindle app, my ipad syncs perfectly with my kindle, so that it will start on the same page that i stopped on with my kindle, so that i can seamlessly move from one device to the other.the only slight disappointment that i had with it, was that the battery doesn't last as long as they lead you to believe. i found myself having to recharge it about two thirds the way through the book, but realistically that's no big deal to me.if you are debating on whether or not the kindle paperwhite would be right for you to read on, my recommendation is to buy it. i don't think that you will be disappointed.	Lightning Charging Cable
if, like i, you own an earlier generation kindle that isn't a paperwhite, this latest model is well worth the upgrade.if you don't, it's like having a wider but really no thicker or heavier iphone 6 plus to read your kindle app books and to use goodreads on outdoors. it even has airplane mode.it had me at its crisp, crisp backlit display and quick response to touch. i had to really press vs. tap on the older kindle, and it was so slow to takeload.

i recently bought it and it was my first kindle. previously seen the color version kindle fire comparing the kindle paper white vs other tablets i like that you can read ebook only so there is no distraction. usually when i grab an ipad or any smart tablet the least i do is read since there so many other things you can do. the kindle paper white will put you to read the minute you grab it leaving the last page you left off on your ebook. it's lightvery clear easy on your eyesback light for night use adjustable brightnesscomparing all the models this one was the best pick for the money.

the new paperwhite is a big improvement over the first generation kindle i had. the text is much more crisp and easier to read, and the backlit screen makes reading possible in any lighting condition.	Wired Headphones
with this 3rd generation of the kindle paperwhite, amazon really created the best reading experience for a reasonable price. i previously owned a first generation paperwhite, and the increase in resolution 300ppi, up from 212ppi is really noticeable. after reading on this for a while, it is slightly disturbing to see jagged edges around text of the older paperwhite. the white balance of the screen has also improved, with a slightly warmer, bookish experience instead of the cooler, electronicdisplayish screen of the old on. additionally, the screen can get crazy low in brightness! ideal for someone who prefers to read in bed at night with the lights turned off. if you thought the previous kindles got dark, this takes it to a whole new level of dimness.	Lightning Charging Cable
the new version has 300ppi, which is the same as the voyage. there is no reason to pay for extra 80 just for the page press.	Google Phone
i used to read with my ipad , but there was always a glare in the car and even in my house when the sun was coming in the window. the paperwhite takes care of all glare problems i had, so now i can read whenever and wherever i want.	Lightning Charging Cable
washer great size, customer service was great, the sales person very nice and helpful.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had an older kindle and enjoyed it for many years. after i accidentally left it out in the rain, i was worried that i would not enjoy the newer versions as much as i had the old version. i was wrong. i absolutely love it! i enjoy reading outdoors and it's great to be able to read into the night the fact that it is backlit is great!	USB-C Charging Cable
i love the kindle. reading is so much easier especially traveling and at beach	USB-C Charging Cable
this review comes with a caveat. many tech sites say ereaders are dying, kind of like the ""nintendo is doooooomed"" crowd, or the gps is obsolete argument. i don't disagree. as our phones become more sophisticated and the phone screen sizes continue to balloon up to tabletlike proportions, dedicated devices will continue to go the way of the dodo. but sometimes, if you're interested enough, a dedicated device is precisely what you need. i had key word ""had"" an ipad mini 2 that i had been using as my allround inbed netflix reading machine. except i'd get about 3 seconds in before getting nudged by my wife due to half the room being lit up. as i spend more time reading on my ipad than watching netflix, i decided to sell my ipad mini and just buy 2 kindles one for my wife and myself. the new kindle paperwhite feels just as solid as the outgoing model, but the resolution is now 300 dpi. the eink screen almost feels like a page of a paperback when you swipe, and in my personal preference, i like that.the battery is rated to last 68 weeks on average between the various tech sites, which trumps my ipad mini by several life cycles. yes the screen has to refresh unlike a tablet, but it's not very noticeable and i don't find it distracting at all for reading.cases aren't nearly as ubiquitous as for the ipad, so you've basically got the standard amazonbranded leather case or offbrand cases from sites like ebay.i enjoy reading, and i frankly don't want to wear any thicker glasses than i already have. backlight can cause bad eye strain, so that's another plus for the kindle over the ipad.in summary, tldr if you want a dedicated ereader, you can't go wrong with the kindle pw. the priceperformance ratio is much better than the voyage imho.but that's assuming that you're somebody who spends enough time reading to make the kindle device worth carrying. if you only read for a few seconds here and there, adding an extra device to lug around isn't for you. so like a garmin, the market has a specific niche and ymmv depending on your needs. for me, the kindle was a great fit.

this is a great reader and has lots of new features. go with kindle paperwhite.	iPhone

i have used the kindle app on an ipad and android tablet and phone and i love it. this is my first kindle device, so i can't compare it to previous kindle versions. the only drawback to using the kindle app on the previoulsymentioned devices is that they can't be seen in direct sunlight. and that is the biggest advantage i see to owning a kindleyou can read outside in daylight. also, the kindle is very light and portable and easy to use. it does what it says it will do and you can't beat the battery life. the xray feature is also a bonus that you don't get with the app.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i use it everyday. battery is great and the screen is marvelous. it even has the web browser, , and i have used it even though it lags. i will recommend this to family and friends.	USB-C Charging Cable

i have owned a kindle since the second generation came out, but this device is by far the best bang for the money. less expensive than the voyage, the new paperwhite looks crisper than the previous generation, feels good in my hands, and allows me to read in the dark comfortably without bothering those around me. highly recommended!

makes me fell in love with reading again. i had an old version, the 4th generation and i didn't expect too much change with the new one. but in fact, it did make me feel total differently. the screen is much more exquisite, the whole materials is not that plastic feel any more. i just love it. the only regret is that, a few days after my made the purchase, there is the 10 saving promotion.

this is my first ereader. i've wanted one for awhile but wasn't impressed with features until the two most recent versions of paperwhite were released i have the latest version. i've read a few books and several magazines on it, so at this point i'm familiar with it. basic functionality is excellent. for reading text it's pretty straightforward magazine articles with images worked well for me, but i can see where screen formatting could be an issue for more complex illustrations. the backlight is very good i wouldn't buy an ereader without it. pages flips are lightening fast, and the touch screen is mostly quite responsive with minimal pressure i have a few complaints, see below. nice integration with the amazon leather cover, you can just close the book and it shuts down. buying books from amazon is simple, and they are delivered via my home wifi in seconds. battery life seems endless, and recharge is simple the included cable charges via a pc, wall charger is an accessory you must purchase. great device for older readers, as you can kick up the font size and lighting for squintfree reading. it's about the size of a small paperback book and as light as a feather.my complaints 1 ads are mildly annoying, it's aggravating to pay more for an adfree version 2 availability of books from my local library remain shockingly limited, even though these devices are hardly new 3 the amazon library for book loans available for a monthly fee is also very limited. i had a 30day trial period, during which time i searched for several classic novels on both amazon and my local library big fat zero across the board for my entire reading list. want to read catch22 or atlas shrugged? you've got to buy it. 4 highlighting is clumsy using a finger, although i've improved over time. changing the highlighted area by dragging the electronic tabs is useless 5 if you like to flip through a book, the paperwhite will take you to the furthest page touched when you reopen the book. if you've read 50 pages, but went forward to see something on pages 180190, you'll return to 191 next time. if you flip around a lot you'll get a real mess. manual bookmarks are the only solution. 6 it's my understanding that when you buy a book from amazon, you are getting a license to read that book on an amazon device only you are not getting a generic ebook that will work forever on any device. so if you buy a different brand of ereader 5 years from now you'll have to rebuy your library.despite all this, i'm glad i bought it and would recommend it if you'd like a dedicated ereader versus a tablet.

i bought this as a replacement for my wife's old kindle 3g. i got the wifi version only since she rarely used the 3g. i have to say that this version is much nicer in some ways and is lacking in others. my wife really misses the physical keyboard, but she has quickly gotten used to the touchscreen. the dpi is much better, and the screen is much easier to read. the refresh times are a lot better. i don't see there being a need to upgrade if yours is currently working, but you shouldn't hesitate if you're in the market for an excellent ebook reader.	Wired Headphones
when i just want to read, the kindle paperwhite is everything i need. it does not strain my eyes, so i can read longer if i want. the front lit screen is perfect in dim light. it is small, so i can take it with me easily. i send documents to it regularly and i prefer reading it than anything else!

purchased kindle paperwhite after my kindle touch of three years fell and broke. i love the light on the paperwhite and that i no longer need to use a separate book light. the light is adjustable, which i love because when i'm reading in the dark in bed, just a little light is needed. great price and great product	USB-C Charging Cable

easy to read in any light, battery seems to last forever, size weight easy to carry along everywhere.	ThinkPad Laptop
the kindle paperwhite does the job it is supposed to do, but noticeably slower than the methods i have used previously ipad, computer, phone. i think amazon needs to bump up the processing power of this device to compete with other tablets and devices. i would recommend this to a friend, but with some reservation.	Wired Headphones
i bought this as a replacement for my amazon kindle paperwhite high resolution the few minor things that were different were added plus but nothing to really stand alone i noticed it was crisper and the light was much better then the previous one.	Google Phone

i find this tablet very easy to use and easy to read at night	Vareebadd Phone
purchased this is a replacement for a television during a move. so far, i haven't been missing the programs. kindle makes reading easy, accessible and fun. i take it with me everywhere i go during the day i live in a busy metro area and it fits neatly into my backpack. great for bike commuters or train riders. accessible, cheap entertainment with a fantastic build quality.side note i originally bought a basic kindle, and traded up for this. very glad i did! it is much better than the original, and the 300 dpi plus back light makes a huge difference.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it is extremely handy and easy to use. the library of books available on amazon is extensive. the ability to have a device that can hold hundred of book in the palm of your hand is unparalleled.	Lightning Charging Cable
the kindle paper white is great for anyone who likes to read on the run. the clarity of the type and the lack of glare make this perfect for any reading environment.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i'm a traditionalist who loves real books and buys mostly hardcovers. as a consequence, i resisted getting a kindle for a long time. i'll have to admit now that i wish i'd gotten one sooner. a tremendous amount of research must have gone into the way readers interact with real books, because nothing about the kindle gets in way of actual reading.	Flatscreen TV
i love reading before going to bed, but backlit electronic devices tend to keep me awake just when i should be getting tired enough to fall asleep. the screen has a great resolution, the device is a snap to set up, and there's little to no glare if you take it outside. additionally, the battery lasts just about forever. straight out of the box i used it for almost three weeks before i charged i, and i still had nearly a quarter charge left. it's now my preferred reading device as compared to my tablets, which include an ipad and an lg gpad. highly recommended.

my wife previously had a nook that sadly broke due to an untimely drop. we purchased the paperwhite and she can't say enough positive things about it. she loves how quickly it connect with an author and the other books they've written. the light doesn't keep her up all night, but she can read without having to have all the lights on so at least i can get some rest. we highly recommend the kindle paperwhite.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i was looking for just the right e reader for my wife""s birthday. she loves to read in bed before she falls a sleep and her old one did not light up so she would struggle to try and read in the dark and use whatever little beam of light she could to be able to read while i slept and with this one it is not even a problem any more the screen lights up and she can easily read while i am sound a sleep.	Wired Headphones
great image quality, fast device. jumped to this from nook and would never go back.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i debated for over a year about getting a kindle. after trying to read my tablet outside this summer with sunglasses and sitting under an umbrella.i finally bought my kindle paperwhite. i couldn't be happier and i've read more books in the past couple of months then i have in years. it's as good as they say and easy to read in any light!	Google Phone
i upgraded to the kindle paperwhite from a 1st generation nook, i think just about any ereader would excite me.however, i did my research and decided that the paperwhite was a perfect fit for me. i love the speed of the downloads and the ease of the touch screen. i love being able to keep track of different characters just by pressing on their name as well as definitions of words that are not familiar i love the backlight no more trying to read at night with a glaring light over my shoulder. i love the battery life. not having to recharge it everyday is awesome! i love how lite it feels and the way it fits in my hand soooo much better than the nook. overall smaller in size although the screens are the same size.i am an amazon prime member and some of the books that i have downloaded and ones on my wish list are half the cost of the same bn books.i find that i am reading much more and totally enjoying the experience of my kindle. i wish i hadn't waited so long!last but not least, i love buying from best buy. i love their protection plans and when needed, they have always saved us .

i needed to replace my much older kindle paperwhite. i love the new one, i use it regularly at the beach.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the best ereader on market. i've had previous ones but love that i can adjust brightness for night time reading without killing my eyes on a tablet.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have had several kindles from the kindle keyboard, the fire hdx and a previous version of the paperwhite. to me, it's the best way to read. you can have hundreds of books at your disposal. having the 3g version enables me to download books anywhere without being connected to wifi. i love my paperwhite!	ThinkPad Laptop
i had a kindle paperwhite that i'd bought in summer 2014, and by summer 2015 something had gone funky it wasn't charging anymore. so i upgraded to one with a higher ppi a couple months ago. the difference is slight in fact i haven't noticed it at all. if i went back to my old kindle i'd probably notice that the quality had changed, but really, it's a very minor upgrade. but that doesn't matter because the paperwhite is awesome anyway! i am a woman, and i can fit it in the back pocket of most of my jeans so dudes definitely can, it slips into small purses and it holds a charge for weeks. i have a pretty big collection of physical books, but i really enjoy having a library on a tablet that i can bring with me too. i buy physical books when i want to linger around a book store, or for poetry, or books that i want to high light or share with people, or that i like the covers of. i buy kindle books that i really want for the story, or that are on sale on the kindle store, or classics that are cheap a couple bucks or free. the vocabulary builder is really nice i just highlight and lookup words that i want to know more about, then it provides a definition for me and saves the word as a flash card so that i can practice later at my convenience. i use my kindle at night the back light is perfect for reading right before bed. i wholeheartedly recommend this device if you just want a reading tablet. i might get another tablet for watching tv or playing games, but i just wanted a dedicated reading one, and this is perfect for me.	USB-C Charging Cable
easy to use, fast response.the display with light is a big plus.	USB-C Charging Cable
improved features and design, crystal clear high resolution screen, and amazing battery life makes this not only a mustown amazon device, but as a dedicated ereader. easy to use for all age groups.	USB-C Charging Cable

i really enjoy the convenience and portability. it is easy to read a few pages when i want.	Wired Headphones
i love the paperwhite. i can read it in any light without glasses. i always have a variety of books, to suite my reading taste. i got a rocketfish wall charger for a great price at bestbuy and it's so much easier to charge my kindle. i've been reading for almost 10 hours on the same charge. if you love books you have to get one of these! my house would be full of books, but now i can get books i would not otherwise purchase because of physical space limitations. i have over 100 books on my kindle and it takes up less space than 1 book. many sites offer free or reduced price books. this expands my reading appetite to other areas i would probably not have even considered before. i love my kindle, my only regret is not getting one sooner!	iPhone
amazon kindle is a great product i bought one as a gift for my nephew and he absolutely loves it.	Lightning Charging Cable

with the newer 300ppi screen the paperwhite really hits the sweet spot in the kindle lineup.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation kindle paperwhite. the backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.the one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation paperwhite is the way it's manufactured when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the eink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. at first i thought this was a manufacturing defect, so i took it back to best buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except morevisible.this appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. when the paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of amazon's ereader line, and amazon was careful to precisioncraft the devices. now, that honor falls to the moreexpensive voyage, with the paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the voyage.this won't be a huge annoyance for some people. it is for me. and it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting amazon over.for everyone else, though, this is a great ereader and well worth the money. if you're looking for an ereader, this is the one to buy.

it is lightweight and fits nicely in my purse. light is just right for bed reading. works well in sunlight.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i have bought this kindle for almost one month, and almost use it every night. it's comfortable for your eyes. i like it.	27in FHD Monitor
i read as many reviews as i could find before buying this newest paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print. however, when i got mine, i had to put the brightness level to 19 out of 25 to get it to a comfortable setting. doing that makes my battery run down before i've even read two books, and that is with the airplane setting on, meaning the wifi is off. luckily, i bought a charger so i can charge my paperwhite while on trips without my computer, in a regular outlet or at night when i'm finished reading. now for the positives. i love the light weight of this kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed. i absolutely love the dictionary feature, because it is so easy to use and it saves the words i don't know, for study. after i've learned a word's meaning, i can delete it from the list. i got the paperwhite with the ads, because it is nice getting suggestions of books i might enjoy that i might not see otherwise. and books are easy to order from the kindle store and to download through this devise. i like the cover, because it protects the screen from scratches while stored in my purse and i also purchased a stylus to keep fingerprints off the screen and i like that. generally, i am happy with this purchase.

my first reader was a sony and i loved it. but it was getting old and quit working well. so i did research and everyone seemed to like the kindle paperwhite and so that's what i bought. i like it. i don't love it, like i did my sony, because its battery needs to be charged every two weeks. the battery in my sony lasted much longer than that between charges. but other than that, it works great and is easy to read in any light sunlight or indoor lighting.

as an avid book reader, i have always loved having an actual book. i was very reluctant to get a kindle at first. however, it has been such a surprise. it's very light weight and thus easier to hold then a traditional book. you can easily download new books at the click of a button. there are daily and monthly deals you can take advantage of for a fraction of the cost of a regular book. the viewing experience is superb because you can change fonts and size and increase or decrease background lighting, making it very easy to read in any light. if i don't know a word i can automatically look up the definition or add highlights or notes. plus, i can carry an entire library with me where ever i go. i actually read way more now than i ever did before. i am extremely impressed with this device and it's more than exceeded my expectations. i highly recommend it to anyone.	iPhone

if you want an e book reader that is light, easy on the eyes even in the dark with a noglare are screen, then you will love this one. it works well even in bright sunlight!. battery life is great! days my only issue is than i have not had any luck using my phone galaxy s5as a hotspot to download books. very frustrating that it will not recognise it for wifi connection, even manually typing it in! it's browser capabilities are also a joke. i shop with my phone or laptop then drive to a wifi location to download books. not ideal. that said, it is a wonderful ""reader"" even though it is overpriced! good luck shopping	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i like the kindle paperwhite. it's very convenient for me to read books and other study materials.the builtin backlight makes it simple to read at night! like it!	Flatscreen TV
i used a nook reader for several years but got no customer service when i needed anything. the kindle customer service is truly first class and the reader is a quality item.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this camera is a little thicker than other ""pocket"" cameras, primarily due to the foldout lcd screen. the screen is a nice feature as it provides additional stability when in the ""out"" position. the zoom capability and image stabilization features are also very good.	USB-C Charging Cable
all i wanted was a reader and this is the perfect solution. love me kindle fire but not great as a reader.	iPhone
i chose the paperwhite primarily because of the backlighting. i also own an original kindle that does not have this feature. i love the new paperwhite! i recently used it on a long trip and truly enjoyed the convenience and ease of use. i loved the fact that i did not have to turn on another light to read!

after using ipad, it is weird to see flickers while reading on a small screen. however, it was recommended by a friend of mine who thinks it is easy on eyes. battery lasts long and you can download work related pdfs to read later. my main purpose to buy was to read docs offline redundant if you have kindle on ipadother tabs.

the kindle paper white is the perfect gift for anyone. my mom had the original kindle and it recently broke. when i was looking for a new one for her i looked at other kindles and ebook readers. i wasn't a fan of the nook and the kindle fire is great, but she wanted something simple just to read so she didn't need the internet connection. after playing with the paper white in the store i decided it was perfect for her. she is not the best with technology, but after i showed her how to use it once she was able to use it on her own. great gift for anyone!

the paper white screen is so easy to read in dark and light conditions. i read in bed before going to sleep and the screen brightness is low enough that it doesn't affect your melatonin production so it won't interfere with your sleep cycles. i used to use a tablet but it was too bright and bulky.	Lightning Charging Cable
i use this product all the time. the screen is great and the ads aren't obtrusive at all. it has great battery life. you can send it books as well with the send to kindle application available at amazon.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

no question about it this is the best e ink e reader available. much easier on the eyes for long reading sessions that any tablet, even one with a sharp screen like an ipad airmini or top of the line samsung.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
just what you need for an ereader. front lighting is very natural and doesn't give me a headache like trying to read on backlight screen like my ipad.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is the second kindle i have owned. paperwhite appealed to me for its readerfriendly settings and backlighting. my first kindle was a keyboard model with no backlight so i used a ""clip in"" light that fit in my m edge case. i forsook the keyboard this time as i rarely used kindle for web browsing. i also abandoned my fear of advertising to select the ""special features?"" model. ads appear only at start up and are quickly and easily dispatched there's only one ad so all you do is swipe up and it's gone. the new kindle has exceeded my expectations. after i get books to put on it, i turn off the wifi and the device will go for weeks without recharging. btw, i purchased an inexpensive fintie case which shuts down kindle when you close the cover and sends it to sleep it's never really totally off. you just have to remember to put your reading on the device itself rather than in the ""cloud"". the backlighting is awesome and the paperwhite eink and font great for older eyes. my only complaint is that the ""collections"" setup is not particularly user friendly and the icons take getting used to on the toolbar. however, i am totally happy with this purchase and glad i updated to paperwhite.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
unbelievable quality. reader is even better at nighttime.	Macbook Pro Laptop

i find the kindle paperwhite to be much easier on the eyes then reading from a tablet. page turning is a bit slower than on the tablet but the headaches are less.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

aside from being about the only eink readers still available, the amazon kindle series of readers offer bang for the buck, and features that you don't know you need. the paperwhite reader is great in sunlight, in a lit room, or even in a darkened room. the available kindle books offer a tremendous variety of genres and titles for a low cost. and with shareware converters like calibre, classics available through public domain are all there to be read. if you love books, then this is for you.

yes most people have iphones and tablets to read on but i find it easier to focus and the new paperwhite screen is crystal clear in any light.	Apple Airpods Headphones
good upgrade from the basic kindle that i had before.	Lightning Charging Cable
got this as a gift for someone, easy to set up and they are enjoying it immensely.	Lightning Charging Cable
this version of the kindle really does a great job as you read for extended periods. the screen allows you to read in different light levels, including outdoors, but more importantly, if you're in the kitchen and then move into the family room, the screen seems to adjust and really makes it a pleasure to use this new version vs. my older version.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
love the paperwhite! no glare easy to hold. the built in light is also great for night reading. i had the kindle app on my galaxy tablet but never used it because of the glare.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
if you are a hardcore reader, this is your kindle! the light makes a huge difference to read under any conditions, its a big improvement from the standard kindle, if you are unsure between one or the other, go for the paperwhite, its worth the extra money.	Lightning Charging Cable
brought this for my son for xmas, he loved it and was very happy with it.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
after much contemplation between a kindle and a nook, i went with kindle due to the number of kindle book purchases. however i love the choice i made. i wanted to be able to read at night without the light. i can with this one and if i fall asleep then nothing is left on. and i love not having to carry my heavy technical books around now either! very happy with this purchase!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
very comfortable to read from doesn't give off a bright light if reading at light. doesn't strain eyes	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this for my wife and she loves it. she's an avid reader and doesn't get much time to do so. this was a perfect gift so she can travel with it.	USB-C Charging Cable

the lighted white screen makes for better reading for your eyes.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i used to use ipad as a reader, but my eye got tired easily. kindle just like the book, and the battery can last longer.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased one for myself a few months ago now this one is for my husband. no glare inside or outside. it adjusts itself once i have my brightness preference set. light weight battery life is amazing!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
purchase went smoothly and the ability to use american express award points at checkout was a plus.	27in FHD Monitor
it's my first ereader ever, so i am a novice. i like my kindle which now is a large part of my life the same way printed books have always been. it's very compact, weighs very little, has great features touchscreen, adjustable brightness, easy to navigate and download books. the battery really lasts a long time as advertised. i just wish public libraries had more books in the kindle format and better interface for ebooks.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
was undecided between new paperwhite and voyage models and doing a lot of research to see which one is best. based on some personal analysis on instore samples, i felt the voyage has nothing more price worthy than what new pw could offer with lesser . if you are undecided like me, don't worry about the gimmicks of voyage, go for pw.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought this kindle because i could not read my older one in the sunshine. this fits the bill.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love everything about this reader. the book advertising on the lock screen is so cool in my house, its such a small thing but it makes us smile every time. i do think its kinda weird that it flickers sometimes but after watching product videos i see that its not abnormal. maybe if i looked it up i'd understand but its not bothersome enough to do so. overall i would buy this item again no questions asked.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i had a kindle for several years that i thought was adequate until i purchased the paper white. what a difference with all of the added features this kindle offers. i like the light with it's brightness feature most of all. the ease of use makes it a great e reader for everyone. i highly recommend the new paperwhite.	iPhone
it's light and convenient to carry. i can, in fact, carry it in my jacket pocket. so it's good when i am moving around by bus. book downloads are instant and don't take a long time something i was concerned about. and the screen is truly comfortable, no strain whatsoever. the functions within the kindle are also convenient enough to use. i bought it for 99 during black friday deals.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i purchased this for my 12 year old granddaughter for christmas. she is over the moon happy with it! she needed no help in setting it up and using it. she used gift cards to load books and has been busy reading over christmas vacation.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
love the backlight of the kindle paperwhite. i would definitely recommend to anyone.	Flatscreen TV
had no problem with the instructions available in the system itself. enjoy the 'easy on the eyes' lighting.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
love being able to have and use. really wanted it.	Lightning Charging Cable
i have loved kindles from the first time i turned one on. i now read about 12 books a year that's a lot for me. i finally upgraded to the paperwhite for the backlight feature. i take it with me everywhere in case i have an extended wait time somewhere. but i mostly use it in bed. the size makes it easy to hold. it's a lot better then holding a cumbersome book and doesn't hurt as much when i start to doze off and drop it on my face. i have set the text size big enough to read without my glasses, get in bed, turn on the backlight, and read in the dark. good for reading in sunlight too. i only read books with my kindle, so i didn't see the need to buy the fire. and i only needed the wifi version no 3g desired. i also didn't see the need to pay 80 more for the voyage.	Lightning Charging Cable
very easy to set up and use. no eye strain, very easy to read on	iPhone
this is an amazing device! i would recommend this to any reader.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
you really can't get much better than a kindle for reading ebooks. the paperwhite is great as it has a touchscreen and has a backlight for reading in just about any environment.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought my wife a paperwhite a couple of years ago while i did much of my reading on my ipad. she loved the paperwhite and i didn't know what i was missing out on. don't get me wrong, i love my ipad, it's just that it wasn't designed to be only a reader. now that i have a paperwhite of my own, reading has become even more enjoyable than it was on my ipad, and i can't think of one negative thing to say about my purchase.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the paper white does what it claims it will do.you can go for weeks on end w only a single charge and it still have juice. reading and import documents such as per files are simple via ""dragndrop"" in the root folder which you'll create, documents. i only which that the ability to read .doc .docx files were available rather than having to convert files to pdf format. the screen is gentle to the eyes to read, whether outside in the sun or a low light setting, backlight or not.	USB-C Charging Cable
i just love this. best investment ever! i am considering buying this again and offering it as a christmas present.	USB-C Charging Cable
i've been rockin' one ipad or another since apple launched them in 2010, and never saw the need for a dedicated reading device like the kindle. that said, i picked one up on a whim during black friday and i finally understand what the fuss is about. the text customization options make it easy to designfind the perfect reading experience, and the fact that i can send instapaper articles to my kindle from all my other devices is awesome. the fact that the screen is lit from the edges as opposed to a backlight makes it noticeably less draining on the eyes.only downside is the fact that amazon makes you spend 20 to get rid of those pesky special offers which force you to swipe the screen to dismiss them every time the device is turned on.	USB-C Charging Cable
the paper white is easy to hold and simple to use. downloading books is very fast. the screen is easy on the eyes and makes reading a book enjoyable.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love my kindle its the best ereader available its the only way to read.	Lightning Charging Cable
my second purchase, new font is very readable in any light and especially outdoors. the battery life is great, no recharging every night like a phone or tablet.	Wired Headphones
i read reviews on amazon some bashing it because they said the screen wasn't paper white. well it isn't if you have the back light off. it's white with the back light on. even with my back light on durning daylight i still got a few weeks of read time out of this. it's amazing don't let others tell you it's not. and the adds only on the lock screen.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a very convenient tool for me to read books, now it saves me a lot of storage of books	Flatscreen TV
first purchase of an e reader. kindle paperwhite is very refined after many generations of change on kindles. device is responsive for loading and downloading new books. backlight is easy to use and adjustable. our library has over 9000 books compatible with kindle for checkout. get the magnetic cover kindle brand or oem as it turns the device on and off with opening.	Lightning Charging Cable
i have one of the original kindles i believe its the second version with no back light so i thought i might like this one. although i still prefer paper books for the most part, this is a nice addition. i think, however, that it should cost less for what it does.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this is a much improved kindle reader than ones made 3 or 4 years ago. much more user friendly	Apple Airpods Headphones
easy to set up, and easy to use. can read in bright sunlight with no glare at all. performs as advertised. battery life is exceptional. will last for 8 to 10 hours on a charge depending on brightness setting.would recommend this to any avid reader. it is light and will hold hundreds of books.

the kindle paperwhite is an awesome alternative to a paperback book. great reading and lighting in all angles and lighting conditions. price is great compared to similar devices. great at what its designed for i highly recommend if you want a dedicated reading tablet.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good ereader if you only want to download books. easy to download from my local library and amazon.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this kindle because i had one of the old ones and i was unable to read it in the dark. this new one solves that problem. my only complaint is that if does not have the hand feel that my old one had, but i had purchased a cover for it and it felt like a book. i probably will get a cover for this one which will solve that problem.

amazon has produced a great line of ereaders that only improve more with each generation update and model. cant go wrong with the kindle paperwhite. i've used the kindle reader on other devices but it is made to be used best with the kindle. bought it at best buy as i couldnt wait to have it to start reading.

my 1st generation kindle broke and i decided to replace it. the back light was the one thing missing from my first kindle. the back light, long battery life, lightweight and ability to store 1000s of books made this an excellent choice for me. i almost never leave home without it.	Google Phone

i love my kindle paperwhite. i read it every night before i go to bed.if you love to read before bed i highly recommend the paperwhite vs. the other kindles the others are like computer screens and it is very stimulating to your brain. this is just like reading paper except you don't need a light on in the room because it's back lit but you can adjust the light from fairly bright to very low. battery lasts 10 to 15 days depending on how much i read.	27in FHD Monitor

not quite as easy to navigate as my old kindle. if i press on a word to look it up sometimes i'm not able to return to where i was. also, i have not had an instance where highlighting a character name and using xray gives a description of the character it only skips to references of the name that are contained in the book. in spite of these few shortcomings i think it's a great product.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the first thought came into my mind after getting kindle paperwhite that why i didn't buy this thing earlier! it is an awesome device. i really didn't think that a digital device can fill up the space of a physical book. highly recommended.	Wired Headphones
i'm loving how easy it is to load my paper white with books and take it along on a trip or to the pool. i've used it on a recent cruise and it was perfect i could read at night in the cabin and not wake my husband since i didn't need to turn on any lights. the ease of use has inspired me to read more, which is nice.

nice to have. convenient for vacations etc. would like it more if the local library had more choices.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
overall i'm pleased with the kindle paperwhite. the text is sharp and easy to read, the memory is more than adequate for all the books i could want to have available. battery life is excellent, going for weeks without charging.it does not get 5 stars from me though. the processor is a bit slow causing a time lag to go from screen to screen or to navigation pages, i also have kindle on my note 4 and appreciate the lagfree response of the samsung. navigation is a bit cumbersome since there are no physical buttons, the ""back"" button in particular is missed.having a dedicated kindle device with great battery life and an amazing screen makes the paperwhite worth having for me in spite of a few areas where it can be improved.	Lightning Charging Cable
this version makes it incredibly easy to read. much better than an ipad.	Google Phone

for the longest time i had been using a kindle keyboard which was good for its time until the 3rd gen. paperwhite came along. the decision was a no brainer especially with the 300 dpi lighted screen and at the same reasonable price. i've gotten used to using the touch screen compared to the physical turn page buttons although every now and then the screen should be wiped to remove oils from our skin that accumulate. there is always something for everyone in the kindle store	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i purchased this for my mom as a substitute for her kindle fire when she goes to the beach. she loves it and no glare when using! great if you like traditional looking books.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

this is the first kindle i buy and i was hoping to be a good experience which so far has been. you may not treat this device as a limited tablet since it is not. it's a reader that works just fine for that. if you compare it you'll feel it lacks speed or responsiveness, but remember that this is just a reader and it works fine for that purpose. the extra feature, the backlight, works pretty fine even at dark rooms without leaving you blind.

being an avid reader with a preference towards hardbacks i was very skeptical of ereaders. because i also travel extensively carrying hardbacks and having enough lighting to read has been a challange. my husband purchased a kindle paperwhite for me for christmas. upon opening i wasn't sure i was ready to go digital however i love it, i've already completed 2 books. the paperwhite is backlit and easy to hold. it fits in the palm of my hand so one handed reading is easy. i am now a believer .

i waited a long time to buy a kindle paperwhite, because i liked my first cheapo kindle just fine. but i love, love, love the fact that it's backlit and i can read everywhere! the only thing i don't like, is with my old one, when i went to ""home"", it listed my books and underlined the one i was reading. when i go to ""home"" with the paperwhite, the books are showing but i sometimes have no idea which one i am reading because it's just showing the covers. i want a list with underlines!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this has been excellent purchase as avid reader it has been a pleasure bringing hours of entertaining joy. i love the lightweight sleek design size. i take it everywhere. it is easy to use capable of downloading everything i need.	Lightning Charging Cable

previous kindle user updating to the paperwhite. easy to read screen and the 3g is a good feature to have while traveling.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i bought this for my fiance for christmas and she loves it. she uses it everyday. the paper white version is fantastic. there is no glare, it doesn't get too bright if the room is dark, and she uses it outside as well as in the car all the time with no screen issues! this device has been charged once and that was when we first got it. she hasn't had to charge it in over a month. highly recommend!	USB-C Charging Cable
you can go cheap for the regular kindle, but in my opinion its worth the extra money to get the paperwhite model. if you had both beside each other or sometimes read at night, you'd go with the paperwhite too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
good kindle not much different from the other ones. worked exactly how i expected it to.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i love having more books with less weight! i also love the way i can read at night!	USB-C Charging Cable
simply great. really comfortable to read, even for hours. took me a bit to get used to the light settings though, but once i got the hang of it, really nice.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i had one of the original kindles for about 5 years and enjoyed it very much. after it was stolen from my office i got the kindle paperwhite. other than having to get used to doing everything by touchscreen i like it even better than my old kindle. i especially like the backlight. and, of course, having everything stored in the cloud meant i didn't lose all of my previously purchased books. i do wish it had multiple static pictures to display when turned off the way the old kindle did.i do hope whoever stole my old kindle enjoys their new paperweight because that is all that it is good for except for the books already on it. i had it locked down as soon as i discovered it missing.	Wired Headphones
couldn't wait for my son to open his kindle paperwhite. for christmas. he was thrilled to get it. but, powering it up he found out it was lighter, more versatile and enjoyable to use. one of the best.gifts i've given.	Google Phone
bought this item as a present for my collegeage son. didn't know much about kindles, but my research led me to this model. may not have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive version, but it is suiting him just fine. easy to use and read, good size. i'm pleased he's pleased!

needed something that i could read at night without using a light. the backlight is perfect.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the best reader out there however don't expect to use this tablet for its web browser function looks strange seeing ""paper"" versions of websites as the paper white feature cannot be turned off.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this paperwhite is just the right size as many paperbacks, but thinner. can read in any light. works as advertised!	Lightning Charging Cable
kindle paper white is great. easy to read with. lightweight so you can throw it in your purse or travel bag take it anywhere. i haven't had the chance to use it outside yet, but will when the weather warms up. best gift i ever gave myself!	Wired Headphones
i had purchased the original kindle s few years ago and in december sprang for the new kindle paper white. i thought i might have been wasting money but it is definately an improvement to the original. it's lighter and so much clearer to read from. it's easier to read in dark situations or on flights at night. i love the differences the new improved kindle provides.

she initially didn't think she would like it as she preferred reading an actual book. she changed her mind after a couple of days and now really prefers it. easy to use	iPhone
i love the amazon white for its size and lighted screen.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i enjoyed reading on my old kindle for many years, however i cracked the screen. i didn't want a tablet because i like how the readers are lighter and easier to read. i read all the reviews for the paper white. it meets all my needs and is even better than the first edition kindle. i love the higher resolution. it's easy on my eyes so i can read for hours. great storage also.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i had a kindle color before. it was great, but the white paper is way better. you don't need a light on to see the print. i use it a lot on airplanes	Wired Headphones
best buy matching prices was great it did match the price offered by other vendors thats why i always go to best buy for all my gadgets need	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i bought this primarily for reading at night without a nightlight as to not disturb my wife. it has been perfect for that and normal reading conditions. i was nervous to move away from actual books, but it has not been as bad as i initially thought.	20in Monitor
i've been a long time user of their main competitor's products and recently purchased this to get a few ebooks not available in the other vendor's catalog. the biggest difference i noticed is that this ereader defaults to having the light on at all times. i was skeptical at first, but haven't seen any problems with battery life and it actually is a little nicer to read, even in moderately lit areas.	Wired Headphones
gave it to my wife who never used a computer or anything hi techshe loves it and had no problem learning to use it.	Macbook Pro Laptop

easy setup, so convenient, don't leave home without it	27in FHD Monitor
excellent product. i did extensive research before purchasing my new kindle. this is the third kindle i've had. only problem with kindle is that their charging port becomes loose and will not charge your kindle.	Lightning Charging Cable
the kindle paperwhite is the best ereader of them all. you can not beat the quality of the screen. it is the same resolution and ppi as the more expensive model of kindle the kindle voyage. the only issue you may have is the limited storage capacity of 4gb, but that's the standard storage for most ereaders.	Apple Airpods Headphones
christmas gift for a family member. they love it. it was easy and quick to set up for them. it will be practical to use at home and to travel.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle! it is one of the best christmas gifts i've received in a long time. it's the ideal version of a book electronically. it's light weight and easy on the eyes. i recommend this kindle to anyone that loves to read but isn't thrilled about carrying around a hard back or paper book.	USB-C Charging Cable
i owned a first generation kindle that was shaped like a book, with one side wider and heaver to mimic a spine, btw when they first came out. then i owned a kindle 2, which really didn't improve much except on the physical shape and memory. but this one is a huge improvement. having the backlit display is completely awesome. i thought i was going to miss a physical keyboard but i definitely don't. if you have a nonbacklit kindle, i'd definitely recommend this one. also, i've played with my friend's voyager, and i definitely don't think it's worth the extra price for what you get.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

best ereader ever! love the back light and how light it is. my boss suggested the paperwhite after she saw how much i love to read and i have to say it's the best gift i could've ever bought myself. if you love to read you won't be disappointed because it reads like an actual book the only difference is it's not bulky and you can actually adjust the backlight as needed. i also love the fact that i can read at night without having to turn on the lamp to see the letters. you can also adjust the font size so you don't have to strain your eyes try doing that on a regular book. over all i can't say enough good things about the paperwhite. i totally love mine!

this refrigerator is absolutely terrific. the features are very well thought out. it works well for a mom who is into healthy eating with plenty of space and for kids with their own drawer for snacks and beverages. it's attractive, too!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

long battery life. great overall digital reader. i highly recommend this product.	iPhone
i bought this reader because my nook was hard to read in the sun. this reader was easy to use and great for any light including sunlight.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great reader, no glare. love my ipad, but this is great if you don't want the glare from light. after using this product it is not as quick as an ipad.	Google Phone
i purchased the paperwhite specifically because i want to be able to read in bright sunlight. i bought this around christmas time so i have not been near a pool deck yet, but i assume it will do what it is advertised as. it has a six inch screen, a bit small for me, but i do like it. it's lightweight so you can put it in a handbag and not feel weighted down. the only thing i don't like is that the screen is black and white, not color like my kindle fire. that took some getting used to but i look forward to laying by the pool and reading a good book while getting some sun!	Wired Headphones
the lighting makes this kindle the best i 've seen.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love reading i have thought about getting an ereader for a while now. the kindle paperwhite is lightweight, has adjustable lighting, is easy to read inside outside, the text is adjustable for both size type. holds a charge for days, even when used for hours at a time. amazon has thousands of books for kindle, many dealsdiscounts even has books that are free. well worth purchasing if you love to read.	Flatscreen TV
i loved everything about my kindle paperwhite but then while reading the other night i swiped to turn the page and nothing happened. it froze after using it for about two years, give or take a couple of months. i've tried restarting it but it does not shut off. i advise you also buy the extended two year warranty or just go back to reading real books.

i bought this as a gift for a teen. i already have one and love it. being able to select a new book to read any time of the day is great. i am a library user so wasn't sure i was get much use out of a kindle. i have grown to love it. many free books are available and you can share your selections with others. functions allow you to increase font size, read it either portrait or landscape great for reading in bed, and screen brightness is adaptable. can play games on it, and you need wifi just to acquire new books. you can take it anywhere to read your books.	Flatscreen TV
i've had an ipad and iphone for years, which also allow me to read my kindle library, but the paperwhite has three advantages 1 you can see it in bright sunlight, 2 the charge will last for weeks, and 3 because it is much cheaper it is less vulnerable to theft and less of a loss if it is damaged. i bought the internet version, but it is also available with a connection to the kindle net, which enables you to download books anywhere, even where there is no access to internet.	USB-C Charging Cable
was trying to decide between the voyage and this model. no regrets whatsoever on going with the paperwhite!	USB-C Charging Cable
wife likes it, and i can sleep at night without the room getting lit up.	USB-C Charging Cable
i wanted to like this a lot because my ipad mini is ""heavy"" to carry in my purse all the time. this is so very light. but they make you jump through hoops to get rid of all the advertising on the device and when you buy it at best buy you are not given a choice to ""spend an extra 20 on a 119 dollar ""book"" or put up with their ads"". i had to go through being on hold forever to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an immediate turnoff. i don't find it to pageturn handle as well as my old original nook or nook color and certainly not anything like the ipad mini. if i hadnt kept it too long to return i would have. it doesn't auto correct to landscape then portrate, nope you have to manually choose one or the other and going back and forth is just stupid.it should have been part of the improved design, they really missed the mark for the price. i can get a full tablet for less money that does all that and simply use the kindle appproslight weightsmall for purseback lightcons1comes preloaded with ads2not easy to get them off if you buy device in a store3page control is not that simple4t doesn't auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one or the other5not as touch responsive to anything6don't like the organization of it	Macbook Pro Laptop

i really like how it light up from behind, which allows me to read it in the bright light and in the dark.	Lightning Charging Cable
i initially read ebooks on my old kindle that needed a light. i then migrated to using my mini ipad with a kindle app. the brightness bothered my eyes and outside it was pretty useless. i bought the paper white as it has a backlight that isn't too strong. love it!	Wired Headphones
a must buy if you want to read without the hassle of a physical book!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
with a 300 book library, i'm an avid reader. but when you're teaching a 1200page behemoth, carting it around becomes a bit of a burden. with the kindle, it weighs almost nothing. plus with the paperwhite, i can read when the wife goes to sleep without getting kicked out because of lamplight! love it	USB-C Charging Cable
after your initial kindle library download, the battery should last 23 weeks with the backlight close to the highest setting.	Flatscreen TV
is there any better ereader on the market? not when you consider the overall quality and low price. this model has the same razor sharp resolution as the voyage but with longer battery life. if you want a backlit ereader, this is the one to buy.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

i like the sleek design. this is good enough for me. works as designed to be.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it took a bit for me to get used to the kindle as i was used to reading the books on my phone with the kindle app. i was a bit bummed with losing the color. i also dont like that it has no sound. other than that it's a nice lightweight device with a good battery life. at first i thought it was defective because it froze up the first time i plugged in the usb. it actually stayed frozen for a couple days before it finally started working again.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this was a gift to my husband. it's the only ereader that can be read in sunlight and since we were going to hawaii, i thought it'd be nice for him not to have to lug along a bunch of books i already had my kindle.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i purchased this as a gift for my mother. i already owned a kindle paperwhite and knew that it would be perfect for her. it is lightweight and easy to hold lit from behind so no glare easy on the eyes and the font size can be easily adjusted. a charge lasts for a week or more. with a kindle you can carry an entire library of books with you. the paperwhite easily slips into a purse or large coat pocket, so you are never without a book whether you are traveling or waiting for someone. i was right about my mom she was thrilled to receive her kindle, and at 86 she is excited about using new technnology.

i had been reading on my ipad mini but i was scared it would damage it carry it around. this is perfect!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

really a nice laptop for a good price. also very good service from the salesman.	Lightning Charging Cable
my phone note 5 is just a little small to hold and to read books on. this kindle is much better. lightweight, easy to read, great battery life. it's right on the edge of being a little big, but that's probably because of what i've been used to.	20in Monitor
i originally bought the more expensive, voyage model, and i definalty prefer this one. it is much easier to grip, and is doesn't get as smudgy. i could not tell much difference in the screen quality, the major noticeable thing was the voyage has a smooth screen, and this one is a little rough to the touch, but that doesn't matter at all.	27in FHD Monitor
this was an upgrade from an older model. it works better in daylight.	Wired Headphones

very portable and usable without the eye strain that is part and parcel of using a back lit tablet for prolonged periods of time. able to read at night without compromising the ability to sleep later due to the suppression of melatonin caused by the bright light of a tablet. a decent cover is a must to protect the unit it is also is easier to hold.	Wired Headphones
it's great to read either in the day or at night. it's light and has nice feeling of touch. my friends bought their kindle long time ago, and i just got mine. the design and everything is better and better. i love kindle paperwhite than the basic one. i would highly recommend it to my other friends if they don't have one.

good screen resolution, very handy, easy to operate, compact great reading device	ThinkPad Laptop
i'm hightech in most ways but have always been a traditionalist when it comes to books. i love the feel of paper in my hands. this was my first ebook reader and i'm surprised to be 100 satisfied. i've read more in the past month than i had in the previous year.i have no complaints about it at all. small and durable. light works great and is easily adjustable. i thought i would hate the advertisements but it's really just on the screen when the power is off, then it goes away when you start to read. i mostly use overdrive for library books, and it's a bit of a pain since you need a computer and the kindle, but it's well worth it.

there is no doubt this is the best available ereader in the market.i was struggling with tablet vs reader but eventually ended up with reader as it gives the best reading experience.	Google Phone
compact, great look without that super bright look of tablets that seems to strain my eyes when reading for a while. not much as far as tablet features, but as just an ereader this is the best out there for now	Lightning Charging Cable
excellent reader. we have amazon prime and access to a number of books with amazom. plus we utilize our local library. this paperwhite is excellent for reading at anytime. good battery life.if you only need a reader, you can not buy a better one. if you want more, look at the kindle fire tablet. good price.

this was a perfect gift for my daughter, especially as she gets ready to go to college.	Wired Headphones
i bought this rather than a kindle fire as i was just looking to read and not use any apps.	Lightning Charging Cable
i spend a lot of time looking at a computer screen when it comes time for leisure reading, it is nice to have relief from bright light. the paperwhite kindle provides a very eyefriendly experience, with sharp text even at a small size. and there's no struggle with holding open pages of a book. unlike the kindle fire, obviously, it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading email. navigation between books is not as easy as i would like a half screen of 6 recent books, with the other half taken up by ""recommended"" books is not as handy as a fullscreen text list of my books would be. but the actual process of reading is easy, and there are a few tools for note taking and seeing how frequently other people highlight sections of text. crossbook text searching is a great feature, if you need it, too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
paperwhite feature is perfect for intended uses. outside, on the beach, at night.	27in FHD Monitor

i was looking for a reader that i could use outdoors and found this device to be excellent outdoors. the battery life thus far has been excellent. it took some adjustment going from my kindle fire to the kindle paperwhite. overall i am very happy with this new device.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
upgraded from first generation kindle. works better than expected	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i prefer this version of the kindle to the previous generation. it has a backlight that can be adjusted easily and its light weight. i did have a crack appear in my screen and it made the backlight shine through awfully bright in that area. unsure how it happened but amazon replaced it nonetheless.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
very nice ereader a big step up from the basic reader that i started with.	Wired Headphones

i love my kindle paperwhite! it's very easy to use and lightweight. the best part is that i can read it outside during the day or late at night in bed. it's easier on my eyes than reading from the kindle ap on my phone.	USB-C Charging Cable
the kindle paperwhite is the perfect ereader. the screen resolution, size, and capacity make a complete package. if your objective is to read, this is the optimal product. if you want to play games or are enamored with color for magazine viewing, do not purchase this product.	Apple Airpods Headphones
briught my kindle paperwhite on a beautiful sunny cruise. it was wonderful. it's easy to read in the sun, or the shade. simple to download books, easy to charge, held a charge for days worth of reading.	Wired Headphones
the price, design, size,and the resolution is perfect!	Apple Airpods Headphones

great for reading books, backlight is useful. love being able to get library books on it. not sure i'm a fan of the ads when the unit is asleep though.	Apple Airpods Headphones
got it for my wife she loves it easy to read loves the fact that does not have to carry a book with. her	20in Monitor
i really like this product. it is my first ereader. my family has had them but now that i have my own i love it. it really looks like you are reading a real page in a book and the backlight is what really makes the difference for me. it allows me to read anywhere even in the dark without worry about fumbling with a reading light. although i love the feel of a real book and watching the bookmark go further through the pages i am starting to get over that. the connivence of holding this instead of a book and also being able to have multiple books going at once without carrying a bunch of books with you is great. i can fit this in my coat pocket on the train while i commute. it is pretty small and now that i figured out how to borrow kindle books from my library via overdrive i save a ton of money by borrowing instead of paying for all my kindle books. i definitely recommend this kindle paperwhite product, the 300 ppi screen is really nice and the price is very reasonable. i couldn't find any reason to buy the more expensive version called the voyage so my opinion is get this one.	USB-C Charging Cable
originally purchased for visually impaired elderly person. i would have liked the screen to be at least 2"" larger.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i've been wanting a kindle paperwhite for a while, putting off buying some books i want to read because i didn't want to be carrying all that weight with me when i'm traveling. i'm so glad i finally got it! i loaded the books on, and it's been really easy to use. the controls are intuitive, and the light is great. easy to use, easy to read on it.	Wired Headphones
i was a little skeptical about reading books on this device, thinking it wouldn't feel like reading on paper. i was wrong. very realistic.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the kindle paperwhite is lightweight and simple to use! i love my kindle! it looks just like i'm reading a regular book but i don't have to worry about flipping pages i just slide my finger or tap!	Google Phone
after ranting against ereaders for years, i decided that i could use one for the long bus trips into and back from work. tablets gave me eyestrain, and one of my brothers who happened to have the same problem with tabletreading suggested doing what he did and getting a paperwhite.this thing is amazing! i am now a firm believer! the simplicity of its controls, the portability, and best buy's 2year extended warranty have made this something i always carry with me!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i didn't quite know what to expect but i'm pleased with the product.	Wired Headphones
i bought this as a gift for my wife who in the past said she would never use a kindle. since getting one, she uses it any spare moment that she has. it is convenient to take on trips, easy to use, and can be read in low lit areas. the antiglare screen is great when used outdoors or in brightly lit locations.	Flatscreen TV
i love my kindle, i did a lot of research and this was the best option for me, i don't regret buying it.	USB-C Charging Cable

we got this item for my parents to use who are not the most tech savvy and even they love to use it! it took them a few days to catch on and fully understand how it works and why its so great but now they each want one of their own	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was actually a gift for a family member. maybe one day i'll cave in and buy one to play around with. otherwise a good little tablet you can carry around in place of books!	Wired Headphones
i love my new kindle paperwhite. i love the small size and the fact that is backlit.	Lightning Charging Cable

like that i can choose to get books from kindle or i can borrow books from my local library.	Wired Headphones
the amazon kindle paperwhite is still the king of ereaders. i have an older version that i still enjoy and it was time to bring another kindle into the house because of my fiancee. she loves the experience that the kindle paperwhite gives for the same reason i do, it eliminates a lot of glare and closely imitates an actual book. this a perfect creation that combines the classic experience of reading a book with the modern convenience of a tablet. a amazon, a frickin' .	27in FHD Monitor

i upgraded to the paperwhite from an older kindle. it's definitely an improvement over my last one and it brings some modern technology to a familiar user interface. you can't really beat what you get for the price.	Product
this thing is awesome! i am not much of reader myself but wanted to get into reading to improve my reading speeds and enjoy a good book every now and then. this seemed to worked perfectly for me. i can say i know enjoy reading very much, even after years and years of never picking up a book.i have always wanted a kindle ever since i saw the wonderful paperlike screen it had, and this one in particular has a built in adjustable light, which is a great feature for reading in dark places.with kindle unlimited it makes it even easier and really inexpensive to read books without the commitment to have to buy the book, not to mention all the free samples.i have yet to even scratch the surface on the newspapers, magazines and other fairly inexpensive subscription based services offered by kindle store. can't wait!	Google Phone
much better then our old nook reader in every fashion	Apple Airpods Headphones
was able to replace with new, with my warranty. this is is little better than the first one	ThinkPad Laptop
my wife has had one for quite a bit and she was always telling me this was the way to go. no matter how low i put the brightness on my phone, it was still a very harsh light. i can easily set the brightness to a comfortable level, still use it in any light, and i find i fall asleep faster at night side it is easy in the eyes.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i moved from a tablet back to the kindle paper white because i can read it anytime anywhere. so happy for the non glare screen	34in Ultrawide Monitor
bought this for my husband. he loves that it is so lightweight and has the built in light.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love electronics and thought the kindle would be nice but certainly not something i needed. it is a reading game changer. it is so easy to take with me, holds a charge for such a long time, but the best part of all is how comfortable it makes reading. my eyes are never strained, i can read in bright sunshine or a deep dark cave. being an audible customer, i can switch back and forth from listening to reading and the paperwhite always keeps my place, it is just amazing!	Macbook Pro Laptop
very light to carry and easy to read in all light situations. the battery life makes it great for when you are on the road.	Apple Airpods Headphones

easy to use. easy to read in any light. the battery last a long time.	USB-C Charging Cable
has a slight 'smokey' look at bottom of page. probably because that is where the ads are shown. cannot reverse background from white to black. reversing to white letters on black background creates less glare for night time reading. amazon is the best for customer service as is best buy. overall, i'm very happy with my paperwhite. it's very light and now i'll read more. very user friendly.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have ebook readers on my ipad, but my kindle is much more enjoyable to use for reading books. it's lighter weight and non glare screen make a big difference.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

a good purchse for my motherinlaw with failing eyesight	Lightning Charging Cable
i have several devices i could read on, but i like to read outside on the deck, at the park, by the pool, etc., and i can't stand glare. the paperwhite is perfect for reading outside. it also has a backlight feature so i can read in the car at night or in the bed without disturbing the wife. the paperwhite is the perfect ereader if you want something with no glare, very lightweight, and one that works seamlessly with amazon. as a prime member with kindle unlimited, my kindle paperwhite is my goto reader for everything.

my parents had a kindle paperwhite they were sharing and loved it so much they wanted another one so they wouldn't have to take turns anymore. unless you're looking for the full android experience with the fire or firehd, this is the best kindle model the voyager model doesn't add enough to justify it's higher cost. my techadverse mother absolutely adores her paperwhite!	Apple Airpods Headphones
like the fact that this is backlit, but has more of the contrast like in the early versions of the kindle that were not backlit	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have the first generation kindle paperwhite and my fiance has the latest and greatest. the screen clarity and response time is greatly improved and it's still being offered at the same price. if you're a bookworm who either reads before bed andor travels a lot, a kindle makes a lot of sense. i like that you can dial in the screen brightness so that you can still fall asleep after reading. the battery life is great, too!	USB-C Charging Cable
the paper white is versatile e reader easy to read in all light and has great battery life	AA Batteries (4-pack)

great product. the future of reading is paperless!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
very satisfied with this product. for months, i have been using both my phone and laptop for reading books, not too bad, but the battery consumption is a dealbreaker on phone and laptop.with this reader, you get weeks of battery life, and the display. it looks just like a page from a book. very easy on the eyes! i have about 300 pdf books on my paperwhite. also, pick up the paperwhite case, very nice to keep your device protected.	USB-C Charging Cable
if you are someone who enjoys reading for long periods of time, then you will really like the kindle paperwhite. the battery life is phenomenal, usually only requiring charging once every 710 days with daily reading. the text is very crisp and clear. the backlight is nice for reading in the dark, however you will note a little uneven lighting and a 'ghost' effect of text at times in the background. overall, i would recommend this to anyone who reads for long periods of time.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love to use it, i read several books in my beautiful kindle	Lightning Charging Cable

the screen is great and doesn't strain your eyes at all, and page transitions are smooth. easy to buy books from amazon either on the device or a computer and get them on the kindle instantly.	Wired Headphones
i initially bought the paperwhite for myself, but gave it to my husband. i had read about the voyager, and they said it wasn't necessarily worth updating from the paperwhite, but if you were buying your first, go for it. it's a bit thinner and lighter, supposedly has a bit better font don't know about that.

so glad i bought the kindle paperwhite. i like that it has a built in light, and i can manually adjust it to my liking.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i own tablets, have a surface pro 4, and have a smart phone. i have the kindle app on all these devices and it works great. this issue with them though is that they aren't always that convenient to carry around. or, if they are, the battery will tend to die. the paperwhite fixes both of these issues. it's very light and feels great in your hands. the screen is amazing and i never have any kind of issues with being unable to see it due to sunlight, a dark room, etc. but probably most amazing of all is the battery life. it's been 2.5 weeks since i bought my kindle and fully charged it. i just now finally went a little below half battery life. i use mine to read books and graphic novels. both look fantastic on the device.	iPhone

i didn't like that this model came with a usb cable but not a plug. other than that, it met my expectations. synching the new device with my existing kindle account was easy. and my initial fear that the touchscreen would collect fingerprints and dirt hasn't been a problem so far.

this is a great kindle it is convenient for school and travel!	Lightning Charging Cable
i guess since i'm saying that this is perfect for reading 4 stars seems cheeky. it's just that since i'm used used using a tablet which is definitely faster but at least i can read anywhere and there is no glare from the sun and it's not too bright which helps with eyestrain.

we love it have had no issues stays charged long.	27in FHD Monitor
i have had a previous kindle before and so i already knew what to expect getting. text is clear and the back lighting makes it crisper depending on the lighting of the room you are reading in. in the dark if i put the backlight on it is possible to read but personally it hurts my eyes. so i bought a separate led clip on book light. i use amazon all the time so it's the company i prefer to buy ebooks from.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i've been using kindles for many years and have tried every model out there. for my purposes, the paperwhite is the best. i have a very wide range of interests in my reading and the ease that the paperwhite offers in creating folders to make accessing books is truly remarkable. it is so easy to switch from alphabetizing by author, date of purchase, or title of book. my eyes give me trouble on some days so i really like how easy it is to change font size and background lighting, since purchasing the paperwhite, i have delegated my fire almost exclusively to the role of playing games. almost all of my reading is done on the paperwhite. this purchase was actually a second paperwhite that i use as a secondary kindle which i keep next to my bed for easy access for nighttime reading. even though the paperwhite is so light, having one in each of the places where i read the most is very convenient.	iPhone
bought this as a gift for my mom's birthday. she really enjoys it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love this device more then i thought i would. it's slim and lightweight. fits very nicely into my small purse. the resolution is great. i really like the built in light. i do miss the built in keyboard i had on my previous kindle but i'm ok with that. it does not have the speaker either but i never used them to begin with. the key things for me were the price, resolution, font and built in light. this device met all my requirements. additionally, i purchase all my electronics from best buy and have loved the service i have received each and every time. they have truly earned my continued loyalty.	ThinkPad Laptop
whether you're a bookworm or a casual reader, the kindle paperwhite is a great way to read and discover new and interesting books. admittedly, i only read infrequently since purchasing my kindle. i absolutely love the size and abilities of the kindle and have been reading 45 books per month since purchasing it. highly recommended!

i am highly satisfied with the quality of this product. it has met every expectation for me and i would highly recommend to everyone. better than holding a heavy book in your hand to read,.	20in Monitor
i love this kindle. it's the best one yet. i've owned the original kindle, fire, and fire hd. until i bought the paper white, i preferred reading actual books over all ereaders. ereader were just more convenient to deal with. no books to travel with and no need to find a place to store them. i'm now an advocate of the paper white because its just like reading a book.

good for travel, easy to use and long battery power.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i was a previous voyage owner for a year but then left it on a plane don't forget to check the seatback pocket before you leave!. i was debating whether to buy it again but all the reviews i saw online said it wasn't worth the 80 premium they're right.first off, the resolution is the exact same 300 ppi on both models. the voyage does have better contrast but it's something i stopped noticing after 24 hours. the backlighting on the paperwhite also isn't as even, as i notice it's darker on the bottom but again, i stopped caring after a few uses. the weight difference is negligible and they both have incredibly long battery lives.about the only time i miss the voyage is when it comes to the page turn buttons. on the paperwhite, i have to touch the screen, so when i'm lying in bed, i'm forced to use two hands to avoid it from falling on my face. with the voyage, i could just press the page ""button"" and keep my hands on the border. again, far from a deal breaker and something i adjusted to quickly.overall, the voyage is the better kindle but not worth the premium cost.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
enjoy the kindle. just the right size and easy to handle	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is the best ereader, great quality, great price.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i bought this kindle so i could read in the sun without having any glare. great purchase, can read anywhere i want to.	Wired Headphones
i bought this product based on reviews, and it fits the description as a nearperfect, reasonablypriced, allpurpose kindle reader. the screen's frontlit display allows me to read under all lighting conditions, from bright sunlight to dark, without eyestrain.i bought the paperwhite as a supplemental reader for my samsung tablet so that i could read outside. after several months of use, i'm finding that i do all my reading on the paperwhite.i read several hours a day and the battery lasts four or five days under that usage, which is a great change from my tablet, which needed a recharge daily, usually at an inconvenient time.i recommend buying the companion leather case because the case puts the paperwhite to sleep with the cover is closed, extending battery life.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is my third kindle. i have gifted my older ones to parents and friends as i have upgraded. this model has a great, easy to read screen, and the ability to keep a library worth of books with me during travels is great.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

very useful for those who purchase many titles, who travel frequently, or who just are seeking to save money on buying books.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i can't say enough good about this product. it has led's so the screen is backlit, and yet the battery still lasts for weeks! i've had mine for over a month and i still haven't had to charge it. the capacitive touch screen is perfectly responsive and fast too. it makes no sense at all to pay so much more for the voyage or oasis, when the paperwhite is such a fantastic buy.

my first kindle was not paperwhite so i wasn't able to read at nights. but now i can read it whenever i want.	Lightning Charging Cable

i never thought i'd be an ereader person, always preferred a paper book. i am dyslexic and decided to try out this kindle at the recommendation of a friend. i love it! i've read more books since i bought it last month than i have in years! reasons it is perfect for dyslexics you can change the font size, line spacing, margins, and the actual font. the last reason is the best. recently amazon added the open dyslexic font to the font options and it's fabulous! the next best option i found is helvetica. another thing that i like about the paperwhite is that it has a matte screen, not a led one like most electronic devices. it eliminates eye strain and the ""blue light"" issues at night. i also love that our library has the ability to borrow ebooks, which has helped me save money on the books.	Lightning Charging Cable
must have if you like to read on a tablet. easy to carry and read.	iPhone

i have 2 my other paperwhite is a first generation and didn't hold up so well after the update. this one is great it's quick and brighter. i love the weight on it, doesn't seem flimsy. i got it for 80 will my discount, so it was a steal! i love to read, i go through 4 to 5 books a week at the most! i will be sure to put this thing through it, but i know it will be able to handle it!maybe next time i'll do the oasis!	Lightning Charging Cable
my previous generation kindle paperwhite got scratched a little on the screen, so i debated about picking up a new kindle, but it was worth the 120. the 7th generation paperwhite has twice the memory, runs a bit faster so it's noticeably quicker in responsemaking highlighting and annotating easier, and the uneven screen lighting problem the older kindle had ""shadow"" spots on the bottom edge of the screen has been solved.my only complaint is that amazon continues to put ads on the kindle, which you have to pay 20 to get rid of. it's almost necessary because i use the kindle to view books in church. very inappropriate when the ad for a murder, crime, or romance novel pops up as a screensaver.	Lightning Charging Cable
the kindle paperwhite works exactly as expected. i have no complaints.	Vareebadd Phone
paperwhite is everything i had hoped for. easy to use and perfect screen clarity, regardless of lighting conditions.	USB-C Charging Cable

i'm very happy with the kindle paperwhite 2015 model. i didn't like reading ebooks on ""typical"" tablet screens, which are much better for movies and games. the screen on the kindle paperwhite, however, is built exclusively for reading, and in that regard, it really excels. text is sharp and easy to read in any lighting condition, from darkness to bright sunlight. additionally, the device is lightweight, easy to carry, and fairly durable.

i had resisted a kindle for years and finally gave in for travel. yes, i am one of ""those"" who love books! surprisingly, i really like the paper white kindle. it is easy to read works well in most lighting situations. there are two things that keep me from loving it. 1 i really wish it had the option of reading the book out loud. 2 i thought it would be a lot cheaper to get books for the kindle. it may be a little cheaper but not a lot. you would think that without the cost of paper, etc, that savings would be passed on to the customer. since they don't, i tuck it away until i travel.	Apple Airpods Headphones
works exactly as advertised. i love it! great battery life as well.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle ereader paperwhite. i finally had to charge it almost 4 weeks after i got it and first charged. i love how long the battery lasts. i have no problem seeing screen and reading when outside in the sun. only thing i wish it also had was an option to listen to audio on it if i wanted to. the size of the paperwhite is perfect and the weight is minimal.

better than the nook. i switched fro glowlight nook due the lack of previous features. the nook did not improve, so i was forced to switch. i found in the kindle all i need plus more books from amazon.	Apple Airpods Headphones

this paperwhite has a sharp display 300 ppi and adjustable brightness levels. it is extremely easy to hold when reading. included in the box was the paperwhite device, a usb cord, and quick start guide. no power adapter was supplied but i use the one for my cellphone and it works fine. one charge holds me for about 34 weeks.the ads are not as intrusive as i thought they would be however i am displeased with the quality of the ""special offers."" i have found better offers just by searching the web.also you cannot listen to audible books on this device. it is reading only but that doesn't bother me.overall this is an excellent device. since purchasing this i have quadrupled the number of books that i read in a month's time. i highly recommend it to any avid reader.

the kindle paperwhite is a great device for reading in all lighting conditions. the battery life is amazing, lasts for weeks without charge. it also syncs easily to your amazon account. some cons about the device is that it is a bit on the slow side when your shopping around for books on the device and i wish it came with a headphone jack for whispersync.

it does what it is supposed to do. i wanted access to the internet to download books and didn't realize it would not do this feature. i would oniy recommend if a person only wants to read books from amazon.	Lightning Charging Cable

my wife and i like to go to the beach, and lay out by the pool during the spring and summer months. she reads it in direct sunlight with no glare! she also likes to read it at night before we get to sleep. she loves it and calls it her little piece of technology heaven. the kindle paperwhite is small, lightweight, and lights up at night allowing reading without harsh light filling the room. water resistance and long battery life are a plus as well. two thumbs up!	20in Monitor
i love it. it is the fourth or fifth kindle i have purchased.first paperwhite.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i enjoy reading my kindle. easy to buy books. long battery life	27in FHD Monitor
this product has been so thoroughly reviewed that i won't repeat the obvious in any detail. it's great for reading under all conditions sharp typefaces and, of course, illuminated. two small issues 1. in dim light conditions the light at the bottom of the screen is a bit uneven. there are slightly darker areas just above each of the four lights that illuminate the screen. this does not bother me and it isn't noticeable in a brightly lit environment. more annoying is the fact that the search function doesn't work with some books for those, searching brings up no results, no matter what i enter. i have the same books on my kindle keyboard and have to use that to find what i'm looking for. i haven't contacted amazon about this, but it seems odd. on other books, it works as expected. one other thing to keep in mind if you have an older kindle is that it will need to be recharged more frequently, given that it's illuminated. overall, i like this reader as the display is excellent, it's easy to hold, and pageturn and other navigation features all work well. if it weren't for the problem with searching, i'd give it five stars.

love the kindle paperwhite. so convenient to take everywhere. especially to the beach!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
we were hesitant to buy an electronic reader, but started to accumulate so many books we ran out of space to store or give away.so happy to have the kindle and can share on ipad so often we are reading and discussing the same book! love it!	iPhone
it was very easy to download and read the books in the tablet	Lightning Charging Cable
easy for my 88 year old mom to use. screen is clearly visible.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
awesome battery, does every thing i need it to. i love it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i don't consider myself a ""heavy"" reader i read a couple books every few months, but i love my new kindle. it's lighter than some of my books, which is great, but the best thing is that i can read at night in bed without disturbing my wife.the eink display allows you to also read outside in direct sunlight, perfect for the upcoming summer months. it's relaxing to just go out to a local park, sit under a tree, and read your new book.if i had to find a fault with this kindle, it would be the ads. you're already paying a decent amount for an ereader, then if you don't want ads on the lock screen, you have to pay amazon more money. they don't really bother me, so it's not worth taking away a star. they might bug you though, so just keep that in the back of your mind before buying this that you will have to pay amazon 20 to have them removed.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
able to read many more books and very nice to handle	Wired Headphones
it was everything i wanted and the salesman said it would be.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this electronic reader because i was tired of the glare i got from reading on my ipad in the sun. it's perfect! very light and easy for travel, and the screen actually looks like the page of a book.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i'm usually not a bookie kind of person. but reads occasionally. with paper white i got more chance and choice to read. so it helped me to improve my reading habit. a very good investment or gift for anyone of any age	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the night reading is perfect. this is a big improvement from the previous model.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the backlight feature was what i was looking for for reading in the dark. highly recommended.	Apple Airpods Headphones

it's more for people that want to read without glare	Lightning Charging Cable
loving it so far. easy to use considering i'm not super tech savvy.	USB-C Charging Cable
for the longest time, i was using my phone to store a few books to read when i have the time. but it came to the point that my battery was suffering from this. what i love about the paperwhite is the battery life, about 8 weeks. in addition to that, you can turn down the brightness to the point that it looks like an actual page, so its actually better for your eyes. i have about 300 books on my paperwhite so i am beyond satisfied. definitely worth the .	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i've used one before and loved the size, weight and feel.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the paper white replaces my original kindle. i really like the new screen because it is easy on my eyes. great improvement to an already great product. may purchase one for my wife.	27in FHD Monitor
with summer getting closer, i know that i'm going to be reading outside more often, and my tablet won't be a great choice with sun glare on the screen. an ipad or nexus 9 may be more powerful than this kindle, but what good is all that performance if i can't see the screen outside?it's great being able to go sit down at a local park, enjoy the sunshine, listen to the birds, and read a book on the kindle. the eink display is fantastic, and really does look like paper, even in direct sunlight.	USB-C Charging Cable
i own a a previous model of the kindle and like that. i thought it couldn't get any better. them i found this its touch screen and it lights up. so you literally can read it anytime, in the light in the dark. i use it everyday.	Vareebadd Phone
this is an excellent choice for an ereader. i purchased it specifically for a vacation in the sun. it did a great job, was easy to use and overall allowed me to easily read out in the bright sun. the backlit display at night was very nice and makes reading a breeze anytime without problem. i have an older nook book that is color. i chose the amazon version so that i could subscribe to the unlimited monthly reading program. in comparison between the 2 brands i do like the nook better for easy of moving between pages i haven't figured that out quite yet on the kindle, but i'm sure it's quite easy. there's also no person that i can quickly drop into the store to ask a question on how to do something. if you are a person who likes being shown how to use a device. i know my mom who is 80 might have a little problem with some getting the screen at the top to pull down but 95 of the people most likely won't. best thing i like and am glad i invested was the backlight.	Wired Headphones
good reader to carry along for travels. i also bought a protective case from amazon which automatically shut down when closing the case. i only charged once during my 10 day travel.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

lightweight and easy to read indoor or outdoors no light to full light.	USB-C Charging Cable
this kindle is great for reading books. which is exactly what it's designed for. very crisp text in bright daylight or complete darkness. it feels good in your hands weight is balance, it doesn't feel flimsy either. quick page transitions when reading. don't expect it to compete with tablets in the app or visuals departments, because that's not what it's meant to be used for. gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the touch screen tends to be a little picky at times.	Flatscreen TV
this is our second kindle. we got this one because it is significantly better for reading in the sun. our old kindle didn't work well outdoors. we are very pleased with this new one.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i bought this for my wife. she had an older 1st gen reader from another company and the differences are astounding. setup was easy and getting content could not be easier.the unit is light. really light. compared to an ipad it is truly air pun.it works well in any light condition so far.the navigation is a little squirrelly and takes getting used to and there can be a slight delay after a press so that can take getting used to.

i had previously owned one of the original kindles, with paging buttons. it finally gave out, so i replaced it with this model. i like the ability to backlight if you want it, but it still reads beautifully in natural light just as a book. i recommend upgrading and removing ads as quick as you can.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is my first ereader ever and it's amazing. the text is so crisp there is not a pixel to be seen. the device is fast, and i haven't seen any problems in my last 12 months of owning it. battery life is decent i use the backlight a lot so it doesn't last as long as it would without but it's still great. i love how you can borrow ebooks from overdrive and download them on your kindle, easy peasy. kindle unlimited offers a good selection of free books for a monthly fee, and there is a 30day free trial. overall an amazing ereader. skip the cheaper version without the backlight you're gonna need it.

i've sat on my back deck and in the bright sunshine on a beach and had no issues seeing the print. never thought i'd like an ereader, only a real paperback book. but, i must say, i am sold. very lightweight.	iPhone
i had a previous model, one with buttons around the case, not the screen itself. the screen on the one i purchased is brighter, slightly clearer, and the touch screen is far easier to navigate. well worth purchase price if you want to read without the bulk of a book. different fonts and word spacing is great, something that will never be available on book. i gave the nook a try but did not like it, the back light was terrible.

bought this as a gift for someone skeptical to reading on a kindle, and they have really enjoyed it. paperwhite makes it easy on the eyes and the opportunities for new reading material through bookbub.com are a great match. wasn't aware that it had the regular ads on the screensaver, but reluctantly paid the 20 to remove.

enjoy using the kindle white paper. it is compact.	USB-C Charging Cable
i was using my ipad mini to read for a long time, but felt like getting a dedicated device for reading since i am a prime member. i ended up buying a kindle with no back light. don't fool yourself, led lights and book lights do no where near the same job as the paper white. i can hold the device in one hand for long periods of time and the light doesn't wear my eyes down like my ipad. really love the paper white, i'm catching up on a lot more reading.

another classic from amazon. would definitely recommend.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

excellent ereader and great deal. cover is perfect.	Flatscreen TV
i loved this product. its stylish and easy to use. this is for my wife	USB-C Charging Cable
after reading several reviews, i purchased this as my first kindle because it wasn't the lowestlevel kindle but i didn't need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive one. i purchased this specifically because of it's size and ability to read outside with no glare issues. the ads are not annoying enough to make me wish i paid more for the adfree versions. it is a perfect pricepoint for reading outside and on the go.

comments on kindle paperwhite1 basic functioning of page forward back excellent2 footnote action often led to loosing place. it was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. pressing the top right x sometimes returned to text, but often was dead requiring selecting go to footnotes. picking the correct footnote returned to correct position but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote send me off to wrong text position. while doing things right raises no problems it is to easy to get in trouble. enabling the x at all times would be safer.3 occasionally a small print message such as 91 highlighters would appear between the lines. supposed to show where other kindle users highlighted text. does not highlight any text.

i love reading! i was first using my ipad mini as an ereader. originally it was purchased to be used strictly as an ereader but i found over time it was causing eye strain. i couldn't read for more that 2 hours without my eyes starting to hurt. after a little research and watching tons of youtube videos i purchased my paperwhite. i absolutely enjoy my kindle. it's light weight my ipad weighs a ton, it's easy to download and access books, you can read on tons of platforms. i have been using an app called ""overdrive"" to check out ebooks from the library. now i don't have to get in my card and drive to my local library. i can just browse from my home via my smart phone. if you enjoy reading and your thinking about getting a kindle please do! it's the best purchase i've made in a long time! i was limited when i was using my ipad mini. now it's like a whole new world has open up since i've started using my kindle. i have read several books by stephen king since owning my kindle. normally it would take me months to finish a book. now it takes me days!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i have really enjoy this new kindle. i have the older version and this was a great upgrade.it is very good on my eyes and it is also great for nightbed reading	Wired Headphones
i used to have a paperwhitestyle nook, but when it needed replacing, they no longer offered the device. unfortunately, the newer nook's screen would turn black and practically unreadable in the sunlight. so i got the kindle. soo happy! the screen is wonderfully readable, even in bright sunlight, and is capable of being backlit for nighttime reading as well. best of both worlds especially since i seem to take reading material with me everywhere i go!	USB-C Charging Cable
with the advent of technology, picking up and reading a normal book feels cumbersome. this device perfectly replicates reallife ink whilst providing an unobtrusive backlight and enhancing the books with extra information, dictionaries, and wikis.	LG Washing Machine
much smaller and lighter weight than my old kindle. menus are easy to navigate and screens are easy to see. battery seems to last a long time too. love it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
don't know what i'd do without my kindle. i sleep with it and when i wake up in the middle of the night i don't have to turn any lights on.	Wired Headphones
this is a great product and for the cost, it exceeded my expectations! i would recommend this to anyone wanting to carry their book collection all in one device.	Lightning Charging Cable
it's light and it holds a lot of my books! i carry mine always in my purse.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this for my daughter who is 7 yrs old, she enjoys reading,	Apple Airpods Headphones
i was a little concerned how small it was, but the size is perfect. the back lighting is great for when it is darker plus it works well in sun light as well. the touch page turn is easy.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
good product. love how light and sleek it is. will recommend.	Google Phone
got it for christmas. have used it almost everyday. liked it so much got one for my dad.	USB-C Charging Cable
good product, but if you have the old paperwhite, no need for upgrade in my opinion cause i noticed very little difference.	Google Phone
i found the paper white kindle so easy to get used to. i always preferred paper books and could never get used to reading on my ipad or ipad mini because of the weight of them. the kindle is user friendly and light to hold. i love it!	ThinkPad Laptop
it's great, i can't imagine life without it. i love the built in dictionary!	Lightning Charging Cable
i love the kindle, it's great. i love that you don't have to carry a dictionary around, it's has one built in!	Lightning Charging Cable
the paperwhite is a decent enough product for someone wanting an eink screen. i don't understand some of the lack of customization options, even on what seems to be simple things. like why can't i see the time in the status bar? why can't i customize the ""click zones"". also, contrary to amazon's claims, my pc app does not sync the documents that i emailed to the device the android app does, though. i also see their ads when the device is off and starts. if they gave me the ability to save those recommendations as opposed to ""read now"", i might have checked a couple of them out by now. still, for the money, it gets the job done and helps keep my eyes from getting as tired as they did when i just used my phone to read.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it took less than five minutes to setup and start using my kindle. features are easy to use and it's holds a charge for an incredibly long time!	Apple Airpods Headphones
this was a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it	Apple Airpods Headphones
this was a gift for someone else, but i really enjoyed my own too.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is a great way to take a whole bunch of books on vacation without having to pack an extra bag for them. my wife and i put some on their for us too. and the reading surface is great, even in bright light.	USB-C Charging Cable
i never thought that i would need an ereader since i have the samsung note, but i am now would not read on the note anymore. the paperwhite makes reading so much better, my eyes don't feel tired as quick with the paperwhite. highly recommended!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
very good product overall. my wife loves it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i love my kindle. i use to have a nook but my kindle is so much nicer and easier to get b ooks.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i upgraded to the paperwhite after my very old kindle died. i like the paperwhite screen. i hate that the pop up adds and recommendations have absolutely no connection to my reading history. it's very different from earlier kindles so i'm still learning features. i can't understand why the paperwhite costs 23 times what the kindle fire costs.	Wired Headphones
simply put its exactly what i expected. i've had zero problems with it	Wired Headphones
i have been using a kindle for many years. i love the ability to have all the books i am reading on one device.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

right price, works, great, best buy has a great selection	Lightning Charging Cable
great for my grandchildren to keep up on the reading during the summer months it's so easy for the parents to actually monitor whether they do or do not do the reading.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought a kindle fire to read on as well as do other tasks but found that i really disliked reading on the fire. i decided to purchase the paperwhite and love it. in the month that i have owned it, i have already read several books. the screen is very comfortable on your eyes and lighting is never an issue. i highly recommend the paperwhite.	27in FHD Monitor
the kindle paperwhite is a great device. it's easy to use and the size is very convenient. when i take it on a trip, it's like having a whole library with me. compared with the kindle app on my cell phone, i find the kindlepaper white a lot easier to use and the size is better. it's easier to read and it feels like a book.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i put books on it and read them. that's pretty much it	Wired Headphones
got this as a birthday gift for my wife.she loved it!	20in Monitor
this is a great reader for the constant traveler like my self	USB-C Charging Cable
after struggling to read books for the last several years, my husband suggested getting an ereader. i never wanted one, because i previously enjoyed the feel of a real book in my hands. he was pretty convincing, so i went online and researched a few different ones. i settled on this one, after reading so many great reviews. i wanted the voyage initially, just because it had page turn buttons, but i opted to save some money, and the page turning with the touch screen is incredible, i don't think i'd use the buttons, even if i had them. i am already halfway through my first book, and i've had this less than 24 hours. i'm a very slow reader, so this is impressive! i tried it in the sun, and it was extremely easy to read no glare. i also used it while working out today it's very easy to adjust the font to make it easier to read. i am so in love with this, and am so happy we bought it! i am excited to get back into reading, and to have thousands of books at my fingertips!	USB-C Charging Cable
works well i used to have kindle and nook on my tablet, but find having the kindle separate so much better. holds a charge a long time and easier to tuck in my purse and take with me.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i got this kindle to replace an old kindle and a lost ipad that i was using to read my kindle books on. t his kindle with the back lit screen combines the best of both ipad and kindle.back lit but no glare in the sun	USB-C Charging Cable
i love the kindle paperwhite reader. i chose the kindle amazon paperwhite because i can read in the sun. we live at the beach and i like to read outside. it is so easy to use. so many books to choose from. very easy download. has a lot of great features. it is light weight and easy to take anywhere. great product.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this was a replacement for a kindle paperwhite that was lost. i did find the old one after buying a new one and now everyone in the family wants it.	27in FHD Monitor

my wife treated me for my birthday, and i love it! would highly recommend. took a little while to get used to buying books on amazon though. overall excellent.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i am very happy with my purchase of the kindle paper white. i wanted a device for reading at night that would allow me to turn the light off in the room. works well is lightweight and really a joy to read on. very limited and dissappointing selection of protective covers at best buy had to purchase elsewhere.	USB-C Charging Cable
my wife loves this product. i never thought she would ever let go of paperback. but the ease of use and convenience when travel make this perfect for her because she loves read when we go to the beach.	Lightning Charging Cable
it is super lightweight and has an adjustable backlight for easy reading in dim to dark areas, and its not hard on eyes. i love that there is no glare, so reading outside is always on my to do list. it is not only good for reading but finding books as well with goodreads. it has media connections like facebook to find what people you know are reading. downloading books is quick and easy, i just wish i would have spent the extra money on the convenience of free 3g. it also has child functions to make sure your child is reading daily and appropriate books available for them using freetime. they can even earn rewards for how much they read. overall very recommended for anyone.	ThinkPad Laptop
not my first kindle but my third of this model. keep buying them for family!really the best model out there for ease, weight, flexibility.cannot recommend it enough.	USB-C Charging Cable
i own a kindle fire and an ipad and i have a hard time reading them on the beach due to the glare. this kindle reader is small enough to fit in your purse to take anywhere to read. love it!	iPhone

love my paper white. have an old kindle and a kindle fire and now the paper white.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this item as a gift and i've heard great things about the paper white kindle. i'm thinking about getting one myself!	USB-C Charging Cable
i was looking at the kindle and ended up buying the paperwhite for the backlighting which works great. the battery does last weeks as mentioned in the details. i wish i would have waited a few weeks to buy since they dropped the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
great size, easy to use, longlasting battery, great for the beach and pool side with the anti glare screen. even able to read at night with the adjustable backlighting.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a great product for someone who wants to switch from paper back books to electronic media. great to read while outside or on the beach	Flatscreen TV
i've had one of these before, but i lost it in the divorce. i happily bought another one. they're so easy to carry around, and setup is trivial.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i upgraded from a nook glowlight which i had dropped and cracked the shaft of light emanating through the tiny crack was beginning to burn into my retina, so i figured it was time to upgrade. i really like the ease of this device purchases download to it directly, and if you have existing files, you can email them directly to the kindle and it will format them accordingly. the definition on the paperwhite is really nice, and the backlight is gentle on your eyes crucial if you are a late night reader like me. i have the ""special offers"" version, and it is not intrusive at all, just appears on your lock screen. battery has been great so far.if you are an amazon prime member, they even throw you a free ebook each month. and yes, i bought a protective cover for it this time!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i was looking for a reader that was just a reader. i did not want a tablet. the paperwhite is the perfect choice for me. it is very easy to use and has a clear reading surface. it is a great size and i can read outside, inside and in the dark. i read the reviews and then went to best buy to see it. it was everything the reviews said. some said there is a gray area at the bottom of the screen but i did not find that. i highly recommend it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i recently received a kindle paper white as a gift from my wife. i love it!	Apple Airpods Headphones
really happy with this new kindle and the fact that i can read at night and not have to use a reading light.highly recommend	Lightning Charging Cable
no complaints. works great, even in the bright sun and at night!	Wired Headphones
love it! so much better than the model i had previously.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
battery life is excellent. i like the backlight and found the screen easy to read, although it isn't quite as much like paper as some of the other reviews i read make it seem.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
got this for one of our employees. works well and you can see the print well. good point is that it's small and compact. bad point is that it's small and compact. easy to carry around, but more difficult to see words. works great, though! great price too!	USB-C Charging Cable
love this ereader! only complaint is the swipe to turn pages, wish it was an on screen button.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love my kindle, i bring it everywhere with me. great for the price.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought this even though i have an ipad and an android tablet. i wanted this so that i wouldn't be easily distracted with other apps. the only thing is that i wish i could inverse the colors for night time. besides that it has a long battery life and is great for reading books.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
one of my major issues with ebook ls is using screens and the annoying glare. while the paper white still isn't a printed page it does a good job of getting close. with the backlight optional it retains the benefit of being able to read at night too. i love my ipad but prefer the kindle paperwhite for all my ebooks.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i got it to store all my college books without checking to see if they would even be compatible. they weren't. it's my fault for not checking this. the three star rating is because you can buy a good tablet for less and use the kindle app. which is what i did. i can now read my books and have a fully functional tablet.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
compare to the my old kindle this so much easier to read no matter where the place or the lighting.	USB-C Charging Cable
i have had a kindle fire for years, but find i can't read it very well in the bright sun. i bought my kindle paper white for camping and it's perfect out in the direct sun, by the pool. it's also smaller and fits it the pocket of my pool bag easier. now one stays home, and one stays in the camper.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
my wife has an older paperwhite that still functions very well. we decided to get this one for my daughter because she's a book worm. it's worked great and she loves it.	Lightning Charging Cable
easy to read even in bright sunshine. simple to setup and use. long battery life.	Wired Headphones
definitely my favorite ereader that i have ever owned.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i purchased the paperwhite so that i could read in the middle of the night without disturbing my husband. it works like a charm, and helps me to fall back asleep faster. the different light settings are fantastic. i really love the dictionary look up feature too.	USB-C Charging Cable
if all you want to do is read ebooks, then this is the device for you	Macbook Pro Laptop
love this newer kindle easier to read and brighter text	USB-C Charging Cable

love the new light feature added. since 1st generation	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i really love the back light on the paperwhite. i upgraded from an old kindle keyboard with a lighted case and i love having the backlight built in. i considered the voyage, to get the page press feature, but am very happy with the touch screen.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i've used a kindle fire for years and love it but wanted something more light weight to use specifically for reading books. the paperwhite is very light weight and it's easy to use. the touch screen is not always as responsive as i'd like it to be when on the home screen or managing your library, but once you've opened a book, it's easy on the eyes and page turning is very responsive. i'm glad i have this option for reading as it's much better than reading on the fire. if you want a full tablet, get a fire but it you just want to read, the paperwhite is great.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my husband, he loves his kindle. it is very easy to read outside in direct sunlight. we have had others in the past and could not see outside in the sun. he brings this to the beach and it is perfect.	Flatscreen TV
lightweight and handy to use. nice one if you love reading and dont want to keep too many books in your bag	Flatscreen TV
i bought this originally for my wife because she is always reading and was interested in a kindle, though wasn't sure she could ever part with physical books. she loves it! now with the family library option available we can all share our favorite books. i'm looking to buy one for myself and my teenage daughter this week, actually. oh, and my wife has given up on physical books after this she likes the backlight when reading in bed at night and the fact that it lasts for at least a week on a single charge.	USB-C Charging Cable
perfect christmas gift for my mother in law. easy to use and great for reading anywhere. she loves it	USB-C Charging Cable
have been using this kindle paperwhite and it's a lot lot better from reading in tablets. not eye stressing and really very handy. nice product!	Lightning Charging Cable
it's comfortable to hold in my hands, the screen is pleasing to look at and doesn't cause eye strain, the backlight allows me to read at night without being blinded, graphics are crisp when i read a comic, and the longlasting battery doesn't induce charge anxiety. also, as a nice surprise, there are countless books, free to borrow via kindle unlimited, because i'm a prime student member.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this kindle is so easy to use and the screen is very easy on the eyes!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
if you like reading books this will make an awesome companion on your next vacation. the backlight is great too. you can read in complete darkness even if someone else is sleeping in the same room. i bought this for my wife and she loves it. it was one of the rare good gift ideas i've come up with	Wired Headphones
i bought this to replace my failing kindle 3 keyboard. i absolutely love it! the only con i have found is battery life with airplane mode off. it drains rather quickly with it off, turn airplane mode on and it's great!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love the kindle. it is light weight and the back light is great. easy to use and get book from the library or from amazon.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is my 2nd kindle. i love the ability to read anywhere no matter the light, especially at night. i don't disturb anyone with a light if i am having trouble sleeping.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
you get to put all of your books right on this kindle and take it on the go with you. it's great just taking one item with lots of reading material on it instead of having to take all of your favorite books with you.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
lightweight, small size that travels easily. great for reading. email capable but rather clumsy. i bought because of the long battery life and not to drain phone ipad as i travel. great for this purpose!	Apple Airpods Headphones
awesome love how easy it is to read and use even when i amat the beach	Google Phone
i like that it is lightweight and it has the built in light.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my 78 year old mother who had recently broken her wrist. she absolutely loves it! she is reading all the time. light enough she can hold it with one hand.	Macbook Pro Laptop
this is my second kindle paperwhite i have bought at best buy. i wouldn't be without it and take it everywhere i go. the first one just wore out as i had it for several years. i have noticed new additions from the previous one which really helps.	Apple Airpods Headphones
its a great product, easy to use and so easy to carry anywhere !	iPhone
when looking at kindles, i was debating between the paperwhite and the regular kindle that was a bit cheaper. so happy i spent the extra money for the paperwhite. having the backlit screen has been such a life savor and great feature. i loved it while camping and is also nice when reading in bed because you don't need to have a light on waking up the other person. i absolutely love this version and recommend it 100!	Apple Airpods Headphones
great reading experience. all your books in one place. compact. excellent!	Wired Headphones
this is a great product, that doesn't have a lot of distraction for kids. great little reader for the price	Lightning Charging Cable
i cringed at laying down paper to pickup technology. however, it was the best thing i ever did. i have been very pleased with this reader.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my second kindel. my first one was a kindel fire. i liked it and i love to read so i thought i would give this one a try. i love this one more!	Flatscreen TV
if you like to read and like to have more than one option then an ereader is something to consider. i like the screen when reader as it is not glaring like a tablet or computer screen. the ability to adjust the font size is very beneficial for me. i also like being able to highlight words and get their definition. i am not a fan of all of the controls but once you get use to them the kindle is very useful. i wish i could convert pdfs to the kindle format a little better but that is not a fault of the device.	LG Dryer
took me a few times to get used to it and now i love this kindle!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the kindle paperwhite is great for reading anywhere, even at the beach! you can also read it in bed with the lights out so you don't disturb anyone else. i absolutely love it! i have a kindle fire, an ipad, and a samsung galaxy 4 and the kindle paperwhite is far better than any of those for reading!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
the kindle paperwhite is compact, yet big enough to feel book sized. the natural bridge screen is quite easy on your eyes and is visible in any light quite an accomplishment! the battery charge lasts a long time so you don't feel in danger of the paperwhite going dead on you. when i went to guatemala, i was even able to find a browser that allowed me to get a message back home on my email using the paperwhite! i got this one for my wife. if you like to read, i think you would enjoy this little gem.	Google Phone
previously used kindle app on phone and tablet to read kindle books. but the readability on the kindle itself is much better. less strain on eyes and more natural to read for extended time. plus, the light weight and easy handleability is great!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i didn't find the ereader easy to navigate and actually found it confusing. i have an older model and that one is easier to navigate. the new one was skipping pages sometimes also.	Wired Headphones
still a great device even though it's a little older than the voyage and oasis. perfect for reading at night and has great resolution. love it!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
although i've always wished i read more, i never would find the time to get to it. having the kindle made it so practical to own and read books, especially at night time, now that i don't have to keep the lights on and bother my partner.a musthave for anyone, those who read regularly and those who are interested in reading more.	Apple Airpods Headphones
hard to find any gripes for this device. serves its purpose brilliantly. the backlight is excellent, and the built in dictionary is great.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
sure you can get this app on all devices but try reading those screens in the sun. this reader does the trick	Lightning Charging Cable
i love it. long battery life, easy to use, perfect	Lightning Charging Cable
old kindle broke. i love the improvements of the paperwhite. it is all touch screen. the old was not.	USB-C Charging Cable
definitely easy to use, easy to download books, and navigate pages.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
you really can't go wrong here its exactly what you want out of an e reader and nothing more.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
it is all but perfection. it's a library in the hand. inside or out. it reads equally as beautiful in either environment. i only penalize it for its lack of allowing books, bought outside amazon ecosystem, to be included in freetime. freetime is advertised as for kids but i like the idea of knowing how much time i've spent reading and the other offerings of freetime.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's super easy to use and lightweight! i love my new kindle!	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a very simple unit to unit reading if not strenuous at all on the eyes	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i don't like reading too many physical books because it's a bit bothersome to lug around the heavy volumes. having everything in this device is great since it's eink and lit	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this is a great device is you are to read a lot of text.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i love having books at my finger tips, 247. in addition to accessibility, my kindle white increases my vocabulary by offering word wise.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i like this product, particular the translation function that makes reading much smooth.	Wired Headphones

love this! great screen, easy to read in different lighting, and long battery life! the amazon website has far more reviews for books and books are sometimes cheaper. highly recommend.	Wired Headphones
this is my second kindle paperwhite. my first kindle died i believe it was old age as cause of death and the next day i went out and purchased a replacement. so easy to set up and there were all my books. the paperwhite is so easy on your eyes and love that you can adjust the font to any size that's comfortable. can be used with dim lighting or no lighting at all. great for reading in bed.	Macbook Pro Laptop
a great device for readers that don't want clutter. easy on the eyes with an adjustable back light and no glare whatsoever outside, even in direct sunlight.	USB-C Charging Cable
love the kindle paperwhite. it is so light weight but best of all i can read outside. the light also allows reading at night and does not bother my spouse.only problem i do not like the case i purchased online and no covers at best buy or target	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i absolutely love reading on the kindle paperwhite. it's great being able to sit outside and read and not worry about the glare. it's very lightweight and easy to hold in one hand.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased this ereader because it stated you could get library booksvia usb cord and wifi if you are near one. i do not have wifi andthe usb would not transfer. tried everything, neighbor tried, readinstructions, viewed youtube. but it wouldn't work. took it back but it was beyond 15 days and they would only give me credit. i then upgraded to wifi 3g and that better work for the extra money. very disappointed as i felt i had no other choice.

replaced my original kindle which i used to death!.new one is even better.great quality for the price!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very nice matte screen that's easy on the eyes. if you want a ebook reader this is the best one	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
if i would have known how wonderful this was to read with i wouldn't have purchased and ipad. i love this to read whenever, wherever. if you're a reader this is the best ereader.	Wired Headphones
my kindle is fast and clear. i can change the size of the font, making it easier to read.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i decided to get a kindle because i was having issues reading on my backlit tablet. the screen lighting on the paper white doesn't have this issue. i also like the lack of distractions, i don't have emails or texts popping up while i'm trying to read.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had a lower end kindle for years. when that broke, i decide to buy the higher end one that is backlit. the back litghting is nice for reading at night. but the touch features are too jumpyit jumps pages instead of just turning to the next one. it is cumbersome to buy through amazon and difficult to see the list of what you have. i don't know if i'd buy this one over the lowest end one again.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i bought this for my 91 year old mother. she had a kindle, but there were too many buttons and she had difficulty using it. she still has difficulty using this kindle, but likes it much better. there is only one button to press.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is an excellent value. this is easy to read, easy to use and performs like a champ. if you want an all around great reader but don't want to pay a high price, this is the one.	USB-C Charging Cable
had put this off thinking my ipad would suffice but it was hard on my eyes. the paperwhite is easy to download, much lighter to hold while reading, compact enough to carry in my purse when i have some downtime for reading, and emits a much kinder light for reading at night. just what this book lover needed!	Wired Headphones
my wife loves this. the paperwhite is the way to go!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought myself a kindle earlier this summer and love it so much that i decided to get one for my ten year old. i thought she was spending too much time engaging in mindless activities on her phone and computer and thought this might be a good alternative. she has responded surprisingly well. one feature that i really like is the dictionary. if she comes across a word she doesn't know or can't read, she can tap on it, and the dictionary will pop up defining the word. this enables her to use her inference skills to decode the word or understand the meaning better. this has been a nice addition to her bedtime routine.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i love my new kindle. i bought one earlier this summer for myself and just recently for my ten year old. one function that is awesome is its ability to work with the audible application. i can read on my kindle then audible will pick up where i left off, so i can continue with the read during my commute. my kindle will then propose to move my place to where i left off in audible. it has made my commute very purposeful because i am able to read literature for work a lot more efficiently. this may have been one of the smartest purchases i have ever made for professional development!

i love this kindle. it is a replacement for one which was almost 5 years old when the builtin light stopped working. i used it constantly, for hours every day, carried it in my purse all the time, and traveled with it. i will not be without a kindle. replacing it was a foregone conclusion but i still read the reviews, just in case.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
we bought this as a gift for my 85 year old motherinlaw. she enjoys reading, but needed to magnify the text in order to read easily. the kindle is simple enough for her to use and she is enjoying it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
third kinlde and my favorite as i can easily read in sunny conditions. light weight, more compacy and battery life seems excellent.	Apple Airpods Headphones
kindle e reader is a wonderful device. i like the inbuilt light. it does not hurt eyes and it does not have side effects headache or hang over in the morning if used in the night unlike tabs.	USB-C Charging Cable
well, it happened. i became a huge fan of ebooks, preferring them over an actual, physical book! this old fashioned woman with a preference for all that is vintage never ever thought that would happen then came the kindle paperwhite. i think i have read close to 10 books this past month because of the paperwhite! i can make the font larger which is great for my old eyes, and it is lit from the side, so it does not make my eyes tired like typical lcd screens, where the light shoots up at your eyes. because of this, you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness. also, the battery lasts a very long time i usually have to charge it only after reading a full book. and an added bonus is that you can't get any apps on the paperwhite, which sounds like a negative, but that means there is no distractiontemptation to surf the web instead of read. when you open it up, you are committed to reading. it is sooooo much better than my nook, which makes my eyes tired and is a distraction.it is among the best purchases i have ever made!	Vareebadd Phone
it's a reader, wanted to get the cheeper one but you were out of stock. this one works well	34in Ultrawide Monitor
great to have my entire library with me and no i can read in bed with the backlight also.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought it for my son, who really loves to read. he is very happy with it. it has a nice design, screen is very comfortable to look at. and it's lightweight. perfect for home use and travel.	Apple Airpods Headphones
got this for my daughter that is entering 6th grade. not only is she reading more, but reading more complex books and expanding her vocabulary tremendously with the word ""look up"" feature. screen is free of glare and looks much like a paper book as the name implies. great for learning and recreational reading.	Apple Airpods Headphones

great size, easy to carry to take everywhere , good battery life	Lightning Charging Cable
the best ereader that i have ever used. i would recommend it!	USB-C Charging Cable
the paperwhite is an excellent product. it is very lightweight, easy to hold for long periods of time, and userfriendly software wise. be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet or amazon fire this is because of the eink. however, i will take the trade off, as you are able to read eink in every environment sunlight, dark rooms without any eyestrain something that is not possible with a regular tablet. screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this.if you have a prime membership, you have access to all of amazon's library, which has a large selection however, most disappointingly, you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to amazon's kindle app, which is an additional 10month. i find this to be mildly frustrating. however, you are able to rent books from your local library whenever you would like.overall, i think the paperwhite is a fabulous product for reading, with only a few drawbacks. i enjoy reading on it very much.	ThinkPad Laptop
my daughter gave me one of these as a gift. my wife liked it so much i replaced her kindle touch with a paperwhite. nice step up from the regular kindle touch. we both love the backlight.no more booklights while reading at night!	Wired Headphones

i take my paper white reader every where with me. it fit nicely in my purse. i read all the time, even in the car where the sun is shinning in on it. i just love my paper white and wish i had bought one sooner.	27in FHD Monitor
i bought it for my cousin and she loves it. nice and simple.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
with my love of turning paper pages in a book and not being a techie, i held off rushing into buying one of the many tablet readers available. i spent quite a bit of time reading reviews and talking to others before making my decision, and i am so glad i did my research. what i like most about the kindle paperwhite the adjustable screen lighting is spot on and easy on my eyes, whether i am reading in dim room light or bright sunshine outside the ease of syncing it with my computer and wifi the speed of downloading a book the ability to adjust the font size the ability to bookmark and pick up from where i stopped reading and the size and weight which makes it very portable. i opted for an envelopstyle sleeve for storage rather than a cover you might use for an ipad or similar tablet. it's easy to slip the reader out of the sleeve and begin reading. i am thrilled with this device and give it two thumbs up. for me, there is no substitution for the feel of real paper, but this reader comes close.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
long battery life, holds thousands of books so it saves space. fits in most pocketbooks so you can take with you everywhere. glad i purchased it. easier to read than the regular kindle.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
excellent product and makes reading books very easy. very light and allows you to have access to numerous books on the go. the epaper display makes reading really enjoyable and does not suffer from glare and the harsh back light from the displays on phones and tablets	AA Batteries (4-pack)
you will not regret this purchase! the kindle holds a charge for more than a week, is super light weight, easy on the eyes, and allows you to define words with the point of a finger! it even adds defined words to a vocabulary list, so you can review them!	Flatscreen TV
new to kindle. always read a book in paperback or hardcover.user friendly. will never go back to reading books on hardcover orpaperback. extremely happy with the purchase.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had an older kindle, and some of the features were easier to understand. but i do like that i can keep track of the book pages, if i choose to use that feature in the paperwhite edition.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a fully functional tablet allowing you to read with comfort and in full sun. i thoroughly enjoy it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this has become a great option for me to read anywhere. the best part is i have the kindle app on my phone and it keeps track on the pages between the two devices. i'm very happy with this purchase!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i previously had a kindle fire, which i liked, but this is much easier on the eyes for reading, and the battery lasts for days instead of hours. it's great.	Lightning Charging Cable
i already have an ipad but never felt like it was made for reading so i checked this at the store and love how it made me feel. feeling like reading a real book but you also have some features as it's an ereader. enjoy carrying it in backpackpurse, light weight with perfect small size.	iPhone
it is cheaper when compared with other kindle models. but not as good as they are. but anyway, still a good choice if you do not have much budget.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this was my first ereader and i was blown away. great battery life, great screen. it's definitely worth it if you like reading.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is the latest kindle model and is just awesome. highly recommended	Bose SoundSport Headphones
yes, i use my kindle to read books, but i especially like sending document pdfs, such as my daily prayers, to my kindle email account to be converted so i can view them on my kindle. i also appreciate that it has built in lights and i can make the font larger i don't need my eyeglasses! perfect for my reading needs almost anywhere.	Lightning Charging Cable
excellent product focusing on only plain ereadable material, with simple options to operate, no much fancy but worth a million in terms of product worthiness to keep a lot more documents with less memory and has basic internet connectivity option available. happy experience with paperwhite kindle.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i am looking at the oasis and voyage but thinking they will be expensive paper weight in 34 years because that is the average life of kindle, this is my 4 they get slow, froze and die after 34 years. moving from first gen paperwhite to the newest version, here are the noticeable changes1. speed this version is snappy, the new ui takes a little time to get used to.2. the led lighting is even, no more ghost at the bottom of the page.3. cloud storage, book can be opened from the cloud and just start reading.just like any other kindle, set up is easy, downloading over 100 titles of book to the device is fast. i do average 1220 books a year, with the kindle of course, no worries on where to store them. although the form factor of the oasis and voyage is very tempting but that additional price can buy lots of books!one complaint that i have is the usb cable is too short!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
replaced my 10 year old kindle reader with this. nice and light. much faster than my old one too.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great experience using this e reader! never going back to books	Apple Airpods Headphones
love using this. so easy to download and find books, so easy to store, the battery life is amazing. it's like reading a book without the hassle of the space, being able to look up words while reading it amazing. the only thing i wish is that i had gotten one sooner!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i'd been using my phone as my ereader but have wanted to get a standalone reader for a while. the screen on this is amazing and the light is a great addition. if you're on the fence go for it.	iPhone
this is an excellent product, and bestbuy sold it with great condition.	Lightning Charging Cable
if you like reading, this is the thing to get, so much better than tablet for reading.	27in FHD Monitor
excellent improvement over my first kindle which was the original. love the backlight for reading at night.	Flatscreen TV
i love having a kindle. there is no glare and your eyes are not tired after reading for a long time. my only thing is that selecting and highlighting on the touch screen could be more smoother.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i have an ipad that i read books on. unfortunately it's horrible to read on the beach, park or anywhere outdoors in sunlight. the kindle paperwhite is perfect for that.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
wow, so impressed with this new kindle. its replacing my 3rd generation kindle and its so much easier on my eyes. also love the size, weight of the unit. very pleased with this purchase.	Google Phone
i started with the original kindle and it worked great but required good lighting. the paperwhite is so much nicer as you can use anywhere and in any type of light. perfect!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it's okjust okhate the ads and the home screennot as good as original	AA Batteries (4-pack)
lost' my original kindle.this was the replacement!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my first ereader, and i generally like it. the lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. the text is crisp and easy to read. i'm very accustomed to using 8 inch tablets, so a 6"" screen feels a little small, but it if sufficient when you are just reading, and not looking for new books.	Wired Headphones
nice device. wish it was a little bigger. easy to use and read ebooks.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this device because my fire hdx wasn't adequate for reading in direct sunlight. for sunlight reading, i give the paperwhite a 5. however. i cannot change the display time before the screen sleeps, the reading location jumps backward and forward a lot when i touch the screen when i thought i was just going one page either way, the home screen is confusing and not user friendly only 3 books visible on ""show specials"" model and the battery only lasts one day if i read 5 or 6 hours. for those reasons, i give it a 3 for both design options and user friendliness. that's a 3.6. averaged up and gave it 4 stars.	USB-C Charging Cable
so happy with this kindle! it's very easy to use, lightweight so you can carry it in your bag like you would with a paper book, except here you have an entire library with you.it's easy to download books, you can set up a wish list, read several books at the same time and you never loose your page.the screen lights are fantastic when you read in the dark, and there's absolutely no glare when you read in the sun.the only drawback is that i thought i would be able to purchase books on any amazon site so that i could read books in french if they're not available on the u.s. site, and it turns out you can't. you can only purchase the ebooks from the country your kindle is set up. that was a real disappointment, as i had read some reviews before buying it where they said you could.overall, i absolutely love it and if you're a book worm like i am, than i would absolutely recommend it. i would actually recommend it to any one.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the screen is easy to read even on the beach and i love being able to download a new book at any time	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
just what i needed. works great inside or outside. must have a cover to protect the screen.	Wired Headphones
very pleased with the performance. thought i would miss turning pages, but i don't. some may prefer a larger screen. i would buy again.	Flatscreen TV
i bought this for my aunt. she reads all the time. as she got older she hated carrying multiple books with her everyday and when she traveled. this kindle solved all those problems. she especially likes being able to read magazines, periodicals, and check out library books electronically. she loves this thing!	iPhone
best kindle ever! love that i can read at night without waking my husband. buy one!	LG Dryer
i love this for the sheer fact that i don't have to carry around all of the different books i am reading. those books can get heavy! the syncing between reading and listening on audible has really improved since i tried using it with the original kindle fire tablet.	Lightning Charging Cable
i originally purchased this as a gift for my daughter and quickly decided that i needed one for myself as well.for the price, you can't find a better screen on an ereader. and the compact size makes it easy to take along with you anywhere. if you are thinking about the cheaper one, it's definitely worth the upgrade.	Lightning Charging Cable
the kindle is amazing and i love everything about it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
overall pretty good picture. picture settings are actually fairly accurate out of the box. hdr 4k picture is great when streaming from amazon.	Lightning Charging Cable
doesn't have the all the features of a tablet but if you want to read in the sun, the paper white is the best option.	Vareebadd Phone
this is my 3rd kindle ereader and it's the best yet. text is clear and device is light. considered the newer voyage and oasis but i believe this is a better deal. it was worth the upgrade from the prior paperwhite.	USB-C Charging Cable
as strictly an ebook, probably can't be beat. the internal illumination really is critical for allaround use.	Apple Airpods Headphones
so far i have enjoyed my kindle paper white e reader.it is light weight, easy to read inside or outside.the battery life so far is fine.i had to order a case charger directly from amazon, could not find instore to fit	27in FHD Monitor
i bought the kindle at a very nice price and everything works well. i like it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
permanent offers of games are a nuisance. but the reading experience is very good.	Flatscreen TV
the paperwhite model has a very clear screen and backlight so i can be used in most lighting conditions. the manual is an ebook which not everyone will be fond of. my only complaint is that it includes a usb cable but does not include a charger in the box. luckily i had a number of appropriate chargers that work well with the reader. compared to the more expensive models, the paperwhite had the functionality that i was looking for at a reasonable price.	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased this product a few months ago and have been very pleased. it is a very user friendly and does exactly what it is supposed to do. it has a great battery life as well.	Wired Headphones
nice reader and my eyes feel better. i also can read at night.	Vareebadd Phone
the most benefit of the kindle is it just could read, hence, i often use it and put my phone away. the white one is so beautiful!	USB-C Charging Cable
it should be easier.to print off highlights and have a choice not.to have every location and other stuff printing with every highlight.it should be easier to erase ""all"" highlights.regular book numbers should correlate with location.easier.to.forward.through chapters.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
didn't know how much i would like this but after trying to read on my tablet outside i decided to give this a shot. love it, i can read in the sunlight or at night no problem, and the battery life is great	Lightning Charging Cable
this was my first kindle, wonderful reading device.	ThinkPad Laptop
easy to figure out how to use. i'm loving always having something to read without having books piled everywhere!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i had an original kindle dx and a kindle keyboard. i decided to upgrade and get the paperwhite and i'm glad i did. the light is great for reading where it isn't very bright. the eink is great for reading outdoors or anywhere. it's easier on the eyes than reading on my ipad. i still read physical books too, but the paperwhite is great for traveling and just tucking in my purse to take everywhere. i recommend it to anyone who likes to read.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the kindle paper white is excellent for reading however 1. product needs to be able to shut off! very unhappy about this. advertising says will hold charge for weeks not so, when kindle paperwhite cannot be shut down. it only holds a charge for a few days, if you read for a couple of hours each day. 2. i have books that i do not intend to read often and want them left in the cloud. i am finding it very close to impossible to return any of my books to the cloud it should be easier! amazon made it easy to change kindle's when i purchased a new one. all kindle's should be user friendly. sadly, this is not the case, with the paperwhite.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i enjoy reading on my paper white kindle. it is easy to learn how to use it. it fits nicely in my purse and is light weight. there are many font choices and you can make the print large.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
upgraded from the old kindle with the keyboard, and wish i would've done it sooner. beautiful screen, nice and light, perfect in every way. the best way to read a book.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this kindle because my library has limited supply of large print books. now i can control font size of print. easy on my eyes with backlit screen. convenient to carry in my bag. long lasting battery. happy reader.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
first time i've purchased this and found it excellent	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the kindle paperwhite has almost made my tablet obsolete. i read a lot and i was reading most of the books on a tablet. it was difficult to read outdoors even with a very good tablet. the paperwhite is so easy to read anywhere in the the brightest of sunlight. i could not possibly put a higher recommendation on this product.	iPhone
i purchased this device as a gift and i got a positive review from many sources. it is good for the eyes and does what it is intended for. price could be little bit cheaper, other wise there is no complain amazon kindle has a lot of source for books	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i am using my second kindle and this third one was a gift for my 83 year old mother in law, very user friendly	Apple Airpods Headphones
i really enjoy my kindle easy to download books and easy to read on the beach	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this kindle paperwhite makes it so easy to read ebooks in several different file formats. i use it every day and am very satisfied with this purchase.	iPhone
love the product, specially the backlight feature.	iPhone
pros the eink display is easy on the eyes, very sharp. great battery life.cons dependant on amazon's infrastructure to manage. because of that limitation i give it 3 stars.	Lightning Charging Cable
more positives than negatives on this one. battery is great, readability is great. the backlight makes low light reading super. the only thing that would make this even better would be water resistance.	Lightning Charging Cable
i love my kindle paperwhite. it is very easy to operate and it holds plenty of books. it is easy to travel with. i would recommend it to everyone	Macbook Pro Laptop
this kindle is a great product and very useful. it was reasonably priced.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the kindle paperwhite is an amazing reader. the battery last for what seems like forever and the clarity of the screen is perfect. the product is also very thin and light, making it easy to take wherever.	USB-C Charging Cable
while most avid readers will say that you can't match the physical qualities of a book as part of the overall reading experience, this is pretty convenient. the soft glow of the screen doesn't assault your eyes after an extended reading session, and it fits nicely in the hands too.	USB-C Charging Cable
i am very satisfied with this new kindle. i had gotten another brand, but had to return it because of problems getting books from a library. after talking to my library on how to download books with this kindle, it was a breeze. the only thing about getting books from the library, amazon will not let some library books be downloaded. all in all, i really like this product.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i am glad that i bought the kindle paperwhite for my daughter. it is easy to use and is perfect for reading anywhere!	Apple Airpods Headphones
this was a gift to replace my first generation kindle. it's smaller and lighter than the old kindle which is wonderful although the screen appears to be the same size. i still much prefer the oldfashioned paper page but there's nothing better than a kindle for the convenience of taking many reading choices on a trip.	Lightning Charging Cable
this kindle is the lightest one yet. easy to operate and great to carry on planes.	20in Monitor
very good reader! bought on sale, excellent value!	USB-C Charging Cable
not much new to be said. beautiful screen, long battery life, great to own if you love to read.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the paperwhite was excellent at first but just yesterday feb. 22, less than 2 months since i purchased it, it froze and nothing i do will work. i am taking it back to best buy and hope they can fix it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought my new kindle paperwhite because it has the lighted background. works perfectly!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is the third kindle i have purchased not counting a kindle fire. i love the paper white. it is so easy on older eyes and the adjustable font size and brightness make reading a kindle easier than a book . the screen is crystal clear whether in bright sunlight or in the dark. it is light weight which like with older eyes makes it easier for older hands to hold. i download a lot of library e books and can carry unlimited reading materials with me in a compact package. i would recommend this product to anyone who reads.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
had my first kindle the original for many years when i lost it. love my new kindle paperwhite. can read in the dark.	Macbook Pro Laptop
it is so much easier reading books with this. the backlight is good as long as set really low. it froze once, but it recovered.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
good reader for teenagers. recommended by a friend.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
our first kindle finally gave up the ghost after many years of use. love this new paperwhite. the front lit screen is great as my old kindle required a case with a light in order to read in the dark.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i never thought i'd like an ereader. i'm kind of a dinosaur. i like real books. the feel. the smell. ah! but, alas, i travel a lot and i read even more. at my age lugging around a bunch of books in my carryon was becoming less enjoyable. so, after my last journey i decided to try a kindle.well, i must say i'm not going back to paper! it downloads titles in seconds, holds a minilibrary, and fits easily in my purse. i'm still on my first charge. the light in the display makes reading in low or no light possible. the screen prevents glare. and, the controls are easy enough for a technophobe such as myself. fantastic!	LG Dryer
have enjoyed using the touch screen to operate. the page light adjustment has been very useful, especially when reading in bed with my wife sleeping.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the most perfect ereader. it is the perfect size. it also has flawless readability with adjustable back lighting. it's fluid and responsive and lightweight enough to be comfortable yet solid enough to feel sturdy and well made. the power consumptionbattery life is also wonderful. it is perfect for readers. for those who do not read much, you will become a reader after buying one. this is concentrated nondistracting portable access to knowledge.	Flatscreen TV
it's cool but it's kind of slow. i don't feel it's worth 119. maybe like 70	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the best way to read a lot of ebooks from any kind to a great price!	Apple Airpods Headphones
my wife was getting frustrated that she couldn't see the screen on her nook samsung tab 4 when she would be on the beach or out in the sun, both places she wants to read. after comparing reviews of the kindle and the nook glowlight plus, she chose the kindle and has been quite happy with the decision. she gets most of her books from our library with overdrive and has had no problem with downloading them from amazon. the kindle is light and holds and feels like a book. she added a cover off amazon so it turns on and off when it is openedclosed. she likes being able to read out on our deck or in the sunroom just as easily as she does inside.	Apple Airpods Headphones
product is good,,no complains better than the old one	Apple Airpods Headphones

the resolution and contrast are good. it is comfortable to read books on this device. the price is ok. i would say it is a good reading device .	20in Monitor
i have been missing out on reading books. this kindle is perfect. my wonderful husband gave this to me for my birthday. what a wonderful surprise.	Google Phone
i bought this for travel so i can read as much as i can without bartering and carrying books. it's easy to read but the size doesn't work for me. i have to hold it with two hands. i was hoping i could hold it in one. in retrospect i would get the amazon fire instead.	USB-C Charging Cable
absolutely love this device. way better than kindle app on ipad or on droid phone.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my husband bought a paperwhite for himself a few months ago but at the time i turned down his offer to buy one for me as well thinking i would continue to read on my tablet. however when we spent time reading and relaxing in the yard i became jealous that he could read his scree so easily while i struggled to see mine at all. in the end i caved and let him buy one for me as well and i love it. it's neat and small and light weight and easy to hold and the battery lasts more than a week.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this newer kindle reader is great. it's lightweight, easy to hold and the battery last long. i will definitely recommend it to friends. the white color is especially classy looking.	LG Washing Machine
easy to read,very sensitive to touch. still can't figure out how to get a new book onto the device. the onoff button is tiny which presents a problem as l have long nails. too technical for a ""book	Apple Airpods Headphones

this is my second paper white and i am very satisfied	Lightning Charging Cable
this is my first ereader, and i generally like it. i've been using it for a couple of months on weekends, and haven't yet needed to charge it since the first time after buying it.the lit screen is bigger, and makes it readable in a wide variety of lightnings. the text is crisp and easy to read. i'm very accustomed to using 8 inch tablets, so a 6"" screen feels a little small, but it if sufficient when you are just reading, and not looking for new books.	Apple Airpods Headphones
easier than reading a book. i don't know why i didn't buy one years ago.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

its a nice product to use, very light and a long battery life.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle paperwhite is a great ereader. i did tons of research before getting one. for me, i was trying to choose between the regular kindle and this one. the major difference there is the backlighting. holy cow, i simply cannot get across how much i've used the backlighting. i mean, i can't even imagine at this point not getting this one over the regular kindle. i've even taken to reading before bedtime, in the dark, and then putting the kindle down when i'm sleepy. seriously, if you're trying to figure out which one to get, the paperwhite is definitely the way to go, especially because of the adjustable backlighting. man alive, what a great purchase.	LG Dryer
told myself i wouldn't buy another ereader until it was waterproof. i got this for christmas and have loved everyday since. it's lighter than carrying most books and it's nonglare and also back lit.	Apple Airpods Headphones
very good replacement for books. small, lightweight, and easy to tote around with you. the paperwhite version has a sharper screen then the regular. thank you best buy for a pleasant transaction.	27in FHD Monitor
this edition does not have backlighting which is a big deal! if you like reading in bed or indoors without needing to use external lighting, you should not get this version! get one of the newer editions! if you only read in well lit areas, then go for this one! kindle is fantastic and i love my white lightweight long lasting kindle with the option to use background light.

able to download books and read most anywhere, best invention since sliced bread according to my wife	USB-C Charging Cable
this ereader is honestly the best that i could have bought for my first one. now, i don't actually read often but wanted to buy something to help me read what i do have within my kindle account. i was stuck between getting this and the original kindle. thankfully, i got this. mostly because of the textured screen and backlighting. the backlight is what did it for me. i read reviews about the original kindle being hard to read in the dark, and that's when i would be reading the most. if i had seen how hard it really as to read, it would have gone back immediately.the weight is a little heavy for constant reading but nothing to really complain about. the battery life could supposedly last 8 weeks. but, apparently i am a bookworm. i have to charge it every other day with max settings.one thing i am thrilled the most about is the easy of accessing a dictionary or encyclopedia, the notes, and the highlighting. it tells you when others have highlighted other sections of a book i am reading as well. im not sure if this is in general a feature of the kindle products, but it is extremely useful.overall , i think this is a great ereader for beginners and bookworms.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great reader for the price. good battery life. a little smaller than i expected but is well built.	ThinkPad Laptop
best buy was supposed to give me 20 for the purchase of the kindle and i was told that i would get an email. i never did. the kindle does what it says however i prefer the buttons to turn the pages that were on the 1st 2nd models. also i prefer to have the name of the book listed rather than a picture of the cover of the book. the picture is too small and unclear which makes it difficult to see which book it is and you only get three on the first page. i prefer to see as much as possible at first glance. also, i love the lighting that is adjustable and allows you to read in bed and does not disturb my night's rest. overall, i really enjoy using it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i can only compare this to the previous kindle and is far superior in all aspects but one, the battery. the battery is a lot less reliable and i do not mean by use, the other way. i was used to left my previous kindle several days without to later come back and use it with a decent amount of battery left. in this case i have found this more than once empty.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
light , love the backlight., able to change font size.	Lightning Charging Cable
easy to use and great for downloading books from the library.	USB-C Charging Cable
this was exactly what i was looking for. it was easy to setup and to use. i found it even better than an actual book for reading. if someone is looking for a product just for reading a book this is the product to get. the only issue i had is it did not come with a recharging electrical outlet product so i had to use my computer to recharge until i got one. now i can charge wherever without the need for a computer. if you want to just read a book this is the product to get. can't go wrong just get the electrical outlet at the same time.	USB-C Charging Cable
i read a ton and this had made if much easier for me to have accessible books! the light is perfect for my when my boyfriend is sleeping and i can't put a book down!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i wanted to have something that i could use outside and not get a reflection or eyestrain from. i found the setup a little clunky but overall i am very satisfied with the paperwhite.	Lightning Charging Cable
the resolution is great and the battery life is amazing.	27in FHD Monitor
this is my first kindle. reading a book always been a pleasure but now is awesome.	Wired Headphones
fantastic display and easy to use, putting the device in rest most leaves an ad on screen which i don't care for. nice long battery life	Google Phone
the paperwhite provides backlighting so that it can be read in dark environments. it still has the same long battery life as the original. the software is pretty much the same. i gave up the whispernet capability in upgrading, but haven't missed it much since i always have plenty of unread material already downloaded over wifi.	Wired Headphones
i like the kindle paperwhite because the backlighting makes it easier to read than the first one.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this kindle is great. i ended up returning it for the simple one, because the light didn't bring that much value for me.	USB-C Charging Cable
replaced my old kindle fire with this white paper. wasn't sure if i would like it without the color screen and wifi connection, however, with my smartphone i really don't need those functions anymore.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this kindle paperwhite especially for reading on the beach and have tried it in bright sun and it is amazing	Lightning Charging Cable

love the battery life, the ability to read in sunlight	Flatscreen TV
this is just what this avid reader needed! now i can read everywhere. even in bright sun light!	Wired Headphones
consistent with all the reviews this is a great product. no downside if you are anywhere of the mindset to use this type of device. have a ipad mini and phone with the kindle app but this is so much better	Lightning Charging Cable
it is very convenient while working out, traveling and stuff. the mic is at the right location and it is good to answer calls as well. i have connected it to my iphone and use it to listen to music and take calls. the best part is even if you don't want to plug it in your ears, you can leave it hanging around your neck!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle white is an excellent ereader which is lightweight. it allows you to hold with one hand with no problem. additionally there is enough room on the sides to hold with two hands without making pages constantly turn.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love my new kindle paperwhite! love the lighted pages and the ability to change print sizes.	Flatscreen TV
i had an original version of these 5 years ago. i never used it then but have been reading more lately. i figured it was cheap enough lets give it a go it has been amazing. i live in hawaii so i bring it to the beach and read constantly. the back light it perfect for night reading. the only weird thing about this is that it saves all of your highlighted areas in one document, but it gives the full citation for each underlined part, which makes it extremely useful if you read different books, but unnecessarily tedious. but either way, great feature.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
kindle allows me to bring all my favorite read with me on the road. great backlight feature and antiglare are both nice features.	20in Monitor
great for reading in low and bright light. easy to download books	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to set up and useeasy to read even in sunlight no artificial light needed in the dark very portable. fits in purse	27in FHD Monitor
have had this fine unit now for about six weeks having previously owned three other ereaders over the decade. so far it is exceptional from the others for the following reasons1. battery life2. text clarity3. back lighting to read in limited light circumstances4. price on sale for 1005. ease of highlighting and saving such highlights to a notes document6. light weightbelieve this reader is not able to withstand harsh handling and would recommend a sturdy cover 8 and the care one might give something fragile as well as having importance to oneself.	Lightning Charging Cable
very light weight reading device, touch screen is very responsive, not whole lot of lagging. you can adjust the backlights brightness with slide down from top. you can browse what you have on your kindle store or buy more books. overall. love it.!	Lightning Charging Cable
this does everything i would ask of it. no complaints.	Wired Headphones
really like my kindle paperwhite. very nice feel, responsive, intuitive menus, and easy to read.	Wired Headphones
very lightweight! just as nice as the next one up that you can only buy online. would recommend this to all my friends and family,	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent for any book lover plus it is great for outdoor use as well as.people who have a challenge with using an ipad type tablet due to the screen blink that can't be noticed due to the speed but is a killer for the eyes.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
love my kindle sleek and easy to use! love that i can control the brightness of the backlight	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i got this for my wife to replace her original kindle that finally died. she loves it and it even food in the same case.	Lightning Charging Cable
the kindle paperwhite is awesome. it is much easier on your eyes than an ipad or even the kindle fire. i read more because it doesn't cause eye strain and i'm not distracted to look at emails or the internet. if you like to read magazines, books and newspapers this is the device to have. there is no better ereader.	USB-C Charging Cable
this new paperwhite was purchased to replace an older 2nd gen kindle. this one is bright, easy to read and small.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
great battery life. however it is slow to respond at times finger sensitivity. otherwise it's great for reading. very useful.	ThinkPad Laptop
love this kindle. worth the extra little bit to have the backlight. very easy to use and worth every penny!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this replaced a paper white that was several years old and acting up. i love the paper whites because i can read them anytime anywhere.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i got this as a graduation gift for my husband because he loves reading. he absolutely loves it! he loves that it doesn't glare but that it also has a built in light for when it gets dark.	Macbook Pro Laptop
was tired of using my ipad as my sole reader. decided to go back to kindle. this is by far the best amazon has done in the kindle arena yet. simplistic, sleek no more eye strain.	USB-C Charging Cable
kindle paperwhite is easy to use, lightweight, and perfect for the avid reader. it easily allows you to take books with you wherever you go since it's so small, thin, and light. the battery lasts for so long, it's easy to find where you left off by using bookmark, definitions are a press away, easy to read in the dark a booklight is not necessary!, and stores an enormous amount of books on one device.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is my first ereader, and it does not disappoint. it's comfortable to hold and it's easy on the eyes for extended reading. the adjustable controls for lighting work great. the only negative for me is that the ebooks my library system uses are not compatible with it. if this is an issue check first.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for a friend. i have the 2013 version and i love it. great gift for avid readers and those just looking for something light to hold. the backlighting makes it wonderful for reading in the middle of the night.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent product, fast shipping, for electronics bestbuy is number one.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use and books transferred without issue nice screen	Macbook Pro Laptop
i have a kindle voyage and wanted another reader because i read a lot. i decided for the paperwhite as it's just a tiny bit heavier than the voyage but just as good. i highly recommended it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
an easy transition from my nook! i only wish i could migrate my purchased books from nook to my new kindle.	Lightning Charging Cable
have tried using an ipad and other devices for reading, i was worried this would not work for my needs. light as a book, even lighter, i don't mind laying in bed or reclining on the couch to read anymore. good for reading heavier books that would cause arm strain to hold while reading. bright at night enough to read with the lights off but not bright enough to bother my wife who is sleeping	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased this kindle to replace my original kindle that is of the same format. i don't believe it was called paperwhite, but its the one without the keyboard at the bottom. it has been a great kindle, however, i've always been disappointed that it did not have a back light. now that i have a back light, i have no idea how i managed before. even reading before bed with the lamp next to the bed on, the back light makes a big difference. the extra resolution is nice, but not really a huge thing when you're talking about text on the screen. the battery life is definitely reduced when running the back light, however, not to the point where i have to charge every night. i'll still likely get several weeks of battery life before needing to recharge. overall, if you're looking to upgrade, this is the kindle to get. the back light is a huge upgrade for me. it helps reduce my eye strain which is important to me.	20in Monitor
i got this for my wife and she loves it. screen is easy to read indoors and out.	Apple Airpods Headphones
it's 2017 and i was wondering to myself if i should jump on board and get a kindle paper white. now and days, people can read ebooks from smartphones to tablets. the thing with me is it caused me eye strain after trying to read my kindle books through my ipad. after much researching and reading the reviews on here, the paper white has been the best purchase decision i've made in order to just sit back and read without causing eye strain. this is only for reading ebooks and is very simple to use. battery life is amazing and only charge once every two weeks. if you are just looking for a plain ereader, then this gem is your best bet.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is a great gift for kids! gave this to a family member and it was a huge hit. cool new tech toy and educational at the same time.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i would have preferred to purchase a 3g kindle, but this item was not in stock and i needed it in a hurry. this kindle does everything that i need although not as versatile as my old kindle.	Wired Headphones
traveling in coach is horrible, so i was looking for a small light weight dedicated device that allowed me to focus on reading. this product is perfection. i've read several books on various iphones, including my 7 over the years, but they're nothing like the paper white display.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
have not had it long enough to give a proper review	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this to replace a kindle fire for my mother. she is losing her shortterm memory and kept getting lost on the fire. this is much easier for her to use. i have owned one myself for several years and i love its ease of use and the selflit screen. the paperwhite is a well made device and i recommend it to everyone.	ThinkPad Laptop
i tend to read at night before bed and the paperwhite allows me to do that without over simulating me, allowing my eyes to slowly tire and fall asleep.	27in FHD Monitor
i had trouble deciding between the regular kindle and the paperwhite because i read at night. it was a great decision, because when i turn the light all the way down, i can't read at night. it's lightweight and sturdy. my only complaint is the speed of switching between books and the strange flicker with the page turn. it's not a show stopper, because it is so much better than trying to read on my ipad mini.	USB-C Charging Cable
more memory and better resolution than prior iterations. much better for reading books versus a conventional tablet due to fewer distractions. easier on the eyes.	Vareebadd Phone
this was the perfect gift to my wife when she felt she needs to start reading now	20in Monitor
the version with the light is the way to go. a case is a must the screen can easily be scratched. over works as intended	Flatscreen TV

excellent ereader. works well day or night. new built in web browser works.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my wife and i have been trying to decide between the paperwhite and the new nook for a while. after checking each out, the paperwhite was definitely a clear winner. amazon support unique features a newfound interest in reading!	Lightning Charging Cable

i love my kindle. if you're a bookaholic like me, there is no cheaper way to read. once you've made your initial investment, there are literally hundreds of books available for free, or 99 cents and other low prices. subscribe to a service that notifies you of these deals and you're all set.

this is my fourth kindle and my second paper white. not much to say as it meets my expectations. i can read it in any lighting conditions, sunlight to dim indoor lighting. battery life is great as in the past. if you had a kindle in the past or present you know what i am talking about. those that have not had one and are thinking about buying one just do it, you will not be disappointed. i suggest that you buy the cover for your kindle. best thing about the kindle is that if you fall asleep while reading it you will go back to the last page you read before falling asleep.	27in FHD Monitor

if you're using an older kindle paperwhite model like i was, the higher resolution and additional font choices available in this model more than justify the upgrade cost.i'd recommend the white case if you can get it. it's a lot easier to find the microusb port when you're trying to plug in a, charging cable.	20in Monitor

how to do not easy to find. needs quick cheat sheet to accompany the product. i didn't think i'd like the back light but i do. i don't have a computer so it's hard to go on line. i'm not sure if i like how the books are arranged, but i'm slowly learning how to navigate around them. i had one of the original kindles so changes are sometimes hard for us older people.

bought one for myself and love it bought this for my 85yr old mom she loves it too	Wired Headphones
this is awesome for reading. much better to read than my ipad mini 2. the refresh from page to page, or when you set a bookmark, is more annoying than using the kindle app on the ipad mini. but for reading books it is easy on my eyes and it can't be beat. i read in bed before going to sleep and i can fall asleep easier after using my kindle than the ipad.

i like the paperwhite read its smaller then my tablet can go anywhere with me and i enjoy reading books on it	27in FHD Monitor
so the only complaint i could see most people had was that the battery life was poor compared to previousnonbacklit versions. i will say that is true, however, with about an hour to 30 minutes of reading, i can go a few weeks between charges. i feel that is very reasonable.as with the kindle ereaders, i have had very good luck with them. they are well built, devices and very easy on the eyes. the device has a good texture and does not feel like it will slip out of your hand while reading.overall i'm very happy with my new kindle. its so much easier on the eyes! worth every penny!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

expensive but good with integrated illumination. has lot of amazon ads, and they asking to buy some new books that ""suitable"" for you! i had the old version with small keyboard and it was with 0 ads.	ThinkPad Laptop
it is white, and it is much better than kindle 6, so paperwhite is a very good product.	27in FHD Monitor
the biggest reason to buy this item is the convenience and battery life. on those two items the kindle delivers. it is not as paper white as i would like. it does lag a bit but overall if you are a book lover this will be a good add on for trips and when you want to read outside.

you will find detailed reviews of kindle paper white online. i will cover some other general observations,if you send a pdf to your kindle email , it will sync it to your kindle. but the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size. you have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font size.you will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with ""convert"" in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email. however it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain varies from pdf to pdf. also if you are used to ios or android, the page turns are not the same like flipping. when you tap or perform a page flip,it will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page. i found this a little annoying but it works. if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctly.battery usage is fantastic.another positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience. they have settings to adjust brightness as well.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle. i have dozens and dozens of books in the palm of my hand. the paperwite screen is just like looking at a page on paper. no eye strain. now, they just need to get the paperwhite with color.by the way, when i received my device from the store, it was set up for the russian language. but, i was able to fumble through the menus and change it to english.

i love my new paper white kindle. i have had it a little over a month now. i have had other kindles before, including the kindle fire. but this new paper white one is the best i have had so far! i love the ability to read it outside, no matter how sunny it is. there is absolutely no glare.this kindle is super lightweighti carry it in my purse all of the time.this kindle also has an amazing backlight so i can read when it is is dark out.definitely worth 5 stars!	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased a new kindle only because i stepped on my original which was the first generation kindle and broke it. i love my new one, particularly the lighting and size of the unit. thank goodness i broke my first!	USB-C Charging Cable
my first kindle has been to about 20 different countries. i just loaded up with some great books and take off on a vacation. i used to load up with actual books and leave them behind as i finished them. i'm on my second kindle and it's just so convenient to read in bed and easy to turn the pages. it also fits easily into my purse next to my cell phone so i can read any time i have a few minutes.	Lightning Charging Cable
i use this ereader primarily for library books. the amazon interface for checking out library books is cumbersome. however, the final result is great. the device works great in both sunny and dark rooms, syncs well with my kindle app on my ipad. battery life is very good.	iPhone
best purchases i've made when it comes to items for reading. battery lasts for days and weeks. the lighting source is awesome and adjustable. i recommend this to everyone who wants to have a book on the go but not carry anything too heavy.	Wired Headphones
this was my first kindle. i did do some research and read many reviews on this one. i have been very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend the paperwhite to anyone looking for a reader.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
you are able adjust the brightness which is good	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it is very light and easy to handle. it fits the rack on my treadmill without blocking heart rate info. took some getting used to but now i like the new home page which shows front cover of the book.	Flatscreen TV
any one lower than this one is not worth it, and if you're a serious reader you will not put this down.	Lightning Charging Cable
it could be a couple of square inches bigger but its great. ability to adjust background light is fantastic.	USB-C Charging Cable
good for reading in low light situations. it is also very easy to hold due to its size.	Flatscreen TV
it does more than my old one plus , is alot quicker than before and over all, the best of the best.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
as with all kindle items, you can't go wrong. very pleased with the backlighting. makes it easier to read in low lighting.	LG Washing Machine
for the price, this is a product that i would recommend to anyone who likes to read.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought the kindle white for my wife. she loves being able to read a book, without having to use wifi.	Lightning Charging Cable
it's nice cool but it responds extremely slow. compared to modern tablets phones kindle is just too slow. my expectation would be to make it faster even if i have to charge it often that would be ok, secondly there should be a home button back button on the body of kindle.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
use for travel light in weight makes reading so easy	Lightning Charging Cable
reads like a book instead of a tablet. saves on book storage space and is always on hand. looks good sitting on my nightstand. no clutter.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i'm an avid reader.i have 7 different kindles including the oasis and voyage. the paperwhite quickly became my favorite! the battery life is outstanding!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i've had kindles before, but they always lacked something that made them practical. one didn't have touch, another didn't have a light, etc. i decided after years of not having one to give a kindle another chance. this one is perfect! it's lite, it's relatively fast, the back light works great, it's easy to read, etc. i've read 5 times as many books on it than i had on all the other combined. best purchase i've made in years.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
perfect i love it glad i did my homework before purchasing best choice for a reader	Lightning Charging Cable
okay, glad it holds alot of books, wish it had send received email.	ThinkPad Laptop
love this kindle. it's a great value for the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love the size and features of the kindle paperwhite.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
there is absolutely nothing that i don't just love about my kindle. the built in light is a nice addition that my old kindle didn't have. i would highly recommend the kindle paper white .	20in Monitor
and this works perfect! kindle does not fail! you will def. get your money worth with this ereader	Apple Airpods Headphones
the paperwhite is great for reading indoors, outdoors and at night. no glare and back light adjustment makes it awesome. get one!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love this device for reading. the backlight comes in super handy when in dark spaces. battery life is great. i like it!	iPhone
this is the second kindle that i have purchased. i love that it is so small and easy to carry around, and the back light is a great feature!	Lightning Charging Cable
the paperwhite makes it possible to condense a lot of books in one small device, thereby saving your house from looking like a warehouse. you can pack a lot of books into your suitcase with a paperwhite. if your device gets stolen, lost or trashed, you may lose a substantial portion or all of your personal library. the paper white allows you to increase size of print big advantage. use of hand gestures to turn page allows faster reading. it's awkward to hold, lying in bed. an attachable gripper would be helpful to hold and read at same time	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have been looking for an ereader with backlight so that i could read under low light conditions. this kindle has met my needs.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i won't leave home without it now! it allows me to take my library with me anywhere i go without having to lug dozens of books around. while i do enjoy the feel and smell of a good book, the kindle is an absolute delight to read from!	USB-C Charging Cable
clarity is excellent. easy breezy to use. charges quickly and lasts a long time	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have been wanting one for a while now and happy i got one	Flatscreen TV

this is the best kindle available. i recommend to al my friends.	USB-C Charging Cable
had an older kindle and this new model is way better. the lighting is much improved.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i would opt for an ipad rather than the kindle just because of the ease of researching books by authors etc. the only advantage of the kindle is the attractive comparative price.	USB-C Charging Cable
easy to use and meets all my expectations for why i bought it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great for reading books and not having to lug around that weight	Lightning Charging Cable
i never thought i would go tech for reading but the kindle has been a great addition.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
works as intended. great inexpensive reader very convenient for reading at home or traveling when don't have the extra space for books. the kids i both use it and i can separate our books so they're not mixed together.the only downside is the lack of color, but i knew this going in it's not the fault of the product.we lose out a little bit by not being able to see the color illustrations and book covers. when getting my kids to read, the colorful covers is often what draws them in.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
have purchased one and found it amazing. i bought second one for my father who find it hilarious	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i am a hardcore hardback book reader it's always my preference. i always said i liked the ""feel size"" of a ""real"" book over any electronic book reader. boy was i wrong. i bought my kindle on a whim while it was on sale, and i absolutely love it i never imagined how much more i would read on the kindle i have gone through book after book after book, while a hardback still sits waiting on my nightstand to finish. it's a great size throw it in my purse and read anywhere. the light is nice for darker reading situations. one of the best features in my opinion is borrowing books. you can borrow one book a month free through amazon's kindle lending library but you can borrow as many as your want from your local library if it participates. that is where most of my reading has come from. i love the kindle more than i ever imagined and recommend to any reader, especially those, like me, who swore on hardback ""real"" books!	Lightning Charging Cable
nice and compact. user friendly, works well in low light	Wired Headphones
easy to use, love that i can download a free book each month since i am an amazon prime member. very light. perfect way to read at the beach.	Wired Headphones

this kindle is by far the best, really enjoy the weight of it and ease on the eyes while reading	Lightning Charging Cable
this kindle is a huge step up from my original kindle. the backlights and touchscreen make navigation super easy.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had a lot of eye strain issues when trying to read off of my ipad and i just couldn't get comfortable while reading a book in bed. this purchased changed everything. i am now going through 45 books a month and i am doing so cheaply.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i previously had a standard kindle.the battery would no longer hold the charge. i wanted to replace it but be able to read in dim light. this feature is great. i chose the paperwhite because the screen did not glare like the fire. it took some getting used to since it is all touch screen, but it has a few better features than the original. one complaint is that it sometime jumps further ahead than one page, so you need to pay attention when moving to the next page. i recommend it for someone who wants to use it for reading only.	Google Phone
i don't know why i waited so long to purchase one! i like that i can check out books from the library, and don't have to worry about not getting them returned late.	27in FHD Monitor
easy device for my inlaws who are not tech savvy.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had the original kindle. it lasted a long time. juts got this paperwhite kindle. it's really 100 better. strongly recommend it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
awesome little toy, back light eases up the use at night but also does not affect screen quality in sun light.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is honestly one of the best purchases i've ever made	27in FHD Monitor
i wanted a simple device strictly for books. i did not want pop up pictures or current events running across the bottom of the screen. this is the tool for me. i keep one at home and one in the car for wait times at appointments.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
finally i can read on the beach or outside! i can take many books with me when i travel without the weight and bulk of paperbacks i can also enlarge the font size so no readers are required!. love this device. wish they would do something like this for cell phones to read in the sunlight!	Google Phone

amazon makes such a good ereader that no other company even tries to make one. there are very few products in the world where that is true. the paperwhite is worth the extra money for the lighting.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have yet to figure out what page of the book i am on. don't really care what percent of a book is left or that i have 5 minutes left in a chapter. after using a nook for many years this is cumbersome. good news way easier to get library books on this.	Wired Headphones
great for reading anytime of day. size is perfect.	Lightning Charging Cable
i still haven't been able to figures out my kindle, it seems like it has very cool features but learning slowly how to take take full advantage of it.	27in FHD Monitor
can't imagine being without a kindle now that i have had one. sure beats carrying around books that don't easily fit into a purse!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

a reader, but the processor is not fast, react slowly	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very good product. working perfectly. nice design!	27in FHD Monitor

this kindle is much faster and has significantly brighter screen than my first generation product. wish i had purchased it sooner!	iPhone
this reader is very light and works great. would buy again.	Wired Headphones
i only bought this because i wanted to give my friend one and she wasn't getting the new one, lol! i had heard there wasn't much difference between them so didn't plan to buy one before. they were wrong. it is so much faster. going into the store, browsing, turning pages and opening books. i used to get aggravated at the lag time and rarely bought books on it, used my phone to buy, because it was so annoyingly slow to respond. speed was the first thing i noticed, the screen looks a bit clearer though i was happy with the old one's screen too. it's worth the upgrade.	Macbook Pro Laptop
it's an ok product. nothing special. not on the cutting edge of technology	Apple Airpods Headphones
have been very satisfied so far. had one issue had the device for 20 days and it would not cut on.i reset the device and it has worked so far.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i was amazinged that it was just what i wanted and didn't know it. you can read in the sun or dark. the screen has a special filter on it. it does a lot more then you realize. love my son can look up words and highlight things for school. the library free borrow apps work too. you won't be disappointed. my 12 year old made me buy him his own	Google Phone

the paperwhite itself is a very nice design and the size makes it portable and easy to hold. the fact that you will be purchasing books from amazon makes it all the better. many, many discounted books for 99 cents to 5 dollars. well worth the price of the reader. was just on the beach in direct sunlight and no problems whatsoever.

this is a good tool for reading without losing your bookmark!	Product
good overall.yep.good	USB-C Charging Cable
i've had every kindle ereader available. though it doesn't have all the features available on the voyage, the paperwhite is the best. the issue i've had are the emergence of tiny light ""leaks"" emerging from the source through the matte textured page background. they're little pinholesized, bright light scattered across the page. it usually begins with just one, or two, and becomes several over time. it's distracting to reading. in a conventional book, it would be like having a small speck of dirt on the page. if these little things don't bother you, then it's not an issue. the paperwhite models don't seem to have this problem as often as the voyage does. i went through 3 voyage models before surrendering and returning to the paperwhite. the paperwhite has fewer total lights, so it's not as evenly lit as the voyage, however, it's nothing significant.	27in FHD Monitor
absolutely love it. so lightweight and convenient to take on the go!	USB-C Charging Cable
great ereader, has a built in back light for reading in low light and in the dark.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
love my kindle paperwhite. my first one lasted years and i immediately went and bought a new one and that one no longer worked it's great for night reading with the back light	27in FHD Monitor

good product for beginners, has basic features necessary	Flatscreen TV
very easy to read and the backlight adds to it and does not hurt the battery time much.	Google Phone
if you've had a kindle you know it's more like reading a book page. some will prefer it enough to have this device. my elderly mother uses the version of this that connects to cell towers and is able to download her own books from her subscription service. she had trouble removing them once she hits the download limit. i have this version. if you have wifi, i think this is the best option if you have the money. i don't see much purpose in the upgrade and i don't know who wants a bigger bezel. the touch works fine. my only complaint is there is no speaker and at this price it should. i had to buy an adapter to have books read to me. the text to speech is very good and realistic.	USB-C Charging Cable
i like it small lightweight easy to see wifi capabilities	Bose SoundSport Headphones
just as i thought, works flawlessly as described by amazon. moving towards automation.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

kindle is always the first choice to read the ebook. comfortable reading experience.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i held off for quite some time on buying this product being it seemed awful expensive for a tablet with only one purpose. i can now say im glad i bought it. no more having to worry about reading on a bright sunny day and just in general seems much easier on the eyes.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is an excellent product at a great price. shipping was great and got here really quick. product itself is incredible and makes reading very easy and comfortable. easy on eyes whether in the dark or in bright sunlight.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i admit i am late to the kindle party. i couldn't understand why someone would get a dedicated ereader when other devices could do so much more. i am now convinced that this is the way to read a book. the battery life is incredible and the paperwhite display is so easy on the eyes. the device is also a great size and can be used one handed without feeling cumbersome.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
gave to mother for mother's day to upgrade her older kindle. she loves it and enjoys the light since it doesn't cause a glare while reading at night in bed.	Wired Headphones
bought for my wife for mothers day, as she wanted something to read in the sunshine this summer, and it performs amazingly in that respect. we have ipads and regular kindle fire units the kids, but only this one can be read in any light, any time of day. only 4 stars as i'm not sure why terribly more expensive than the fire units, but it solves for those who like to read under sunlight at the beach or by the pool, couldn't be clearer.	27in FHD Monitor
love this new addition. the light feature really helps	Vareebadd Phone

bought this a a gift for my wife, who loves to read, but who has absolutely no use for or interest in information technology and the tools of that trade. she can barely tolerate email, and refuses to interact with a smartphone. once introduced to kindle, however, she has become hooked. it is light, easy to carry, seldom needs to be charged, turns pages with a touch, and is a veritable portable library.it was an inspired gift and who knows where it might lead.

i have been reading on a paperwhite for a few years now. when it got damaged i just went right out and bought another. it's light, easy to see without my reading glasses, since i can change the font, and it's great for reading outside, even in full sun. it's worth every penny.	Google Phone
of all the kindle readers this is the best one.i love this, small, easy to read	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
as a lover of books i love the portability and battery life of this. definitely would recommend to anyone.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
let me set the stage for this review i joined a book club this year and have started reading a lot. or at least what i would consider to be a lot, which is about 2 decentlylong books a month.up until buying the paperwhite, i was doing most of my reading on my iphone using the kindle app. long story short, i ended up returning the paperwhite after about 2 weeks. why? because i realized just how sporadic my reading was. i read when i'm out and about, waiting at a doctor's office, or inline at a restaurant, etc. it became overwhelmingly apparent to me that the best ereader is the one you have with you at all times. for me, that's my iphone.the actual reading experience is definitely better on the paperwhite. however, if you're an ""onthego"" reader like me, then it just means you have to carry around another device. dedicated ereaders are for people who either truly read a ton, or have a set routine for reading. if that's not you, then stick with your phone.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
got this as a gift to my mom. she absolutely loved the color and how easy to use.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

was pretty simple to use. user friendly and pretty lightweight.	Flatscreen TV
i took it back the day after purchasing it. the screen looks like you are scrolling through old news print. blacks out each moment you move it. i thought it was a defect but nope. according to the geek squad that's just the way it is now	Lightning Charging Cable

i was using another brand, from another vendor. problematic. continuation of reading erratic. when i began to attempt to read where i left off last, unit would take me back to random page or completely start the book over. went through 2 readers, and both were faulty and very frustrating. the last stopped taking a charge. i read very good reviews of the kindle. pitched the other two and they weren't cheap. the kindle holds a charge for weeks not days and selection and price are light years ahead of the other service. recommended to a friend and she loves it.	iPhone
player has plenty of features and the picture quality is excellent.would have been 5 star except the remote control is on the cheap side.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

nice screen which is easy to read. we will have to see how it hold up with kids in the house.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i was actually a usability tester on the very first kindle and i'd always thought about buying one. after using the kindle app on various tablets ipad and samsung i finally realized that what i was mostly using the tablets for was the kindle app.buying one was a nobrainer and the paperwhite is excellent. the bookerly font is exceedingly readable and the backlighting is adjustable so that i don't keep my significant other awake when i'm reading in bed. it's lightweight and the perfect size for putting in the pocket of my cargo shorts or in a jacket pocket.

upgraded from generation 1 kindle with buttons that had all the letters worn off to this newer generation kindle. love the touchscreen and the ability to sit out on the patio with a fire and read all night without needing additional light.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
and anywhere else! i love it. for the first time since i've had a kindle, i can finally read it outside. great for reading nyt on sunday mornings by the pool!	LG Washing Machine
i love to read but i rarely have time these days. for those who do have the time, this is a great device because you can take it anywhere and read it easily in pretty much any lighting situation. the text is crisp and easy to see but i wish the screen was just a little bigger. i ultimately took this back and went with a kindle fire hd 8. the pros of a tablet outweighed the cons for my situation, but the kindle paperwhite is still a great option for people who read a lot and want to read their books anywhere they go.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i had an original kindle wifi only and loved it, however was limited when reading at night i didn't want to have to attach a light or use a flashlight. the kindle paperwhite solves my dilemma! i would specifically recommend it for those who are frequent fliers.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great little reader! easy to use and download books. the backlight helps in all lighting situations. long battery life	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the amazon kindle paperwhite was a gift to my husband. he is very happy with it for several reasons. reading from the nonreflective screen is effortless, and he can adjust the size of the characters. he can take notes and highlight parts of the text. two really neat features are 1. if you take notes on a book that you borrowed from the library, those notes will still be there even after you return the book. so, if you happen to borrow the same book a few weeks later, when you open the book on your ereader, your notes will be there. 2. in a complicated story with lots of characters, the ereader keeps track of who is who. in a paper book, you would have to flip the pages back and forth to figure that out. no need to do this with the ereader.	Flatscreen TV
i find this perfect for reading. it's much lighter than the mini ipad. easier on the eyes.	Lightning Charging Cable
this reader does what i expected and has good battery life.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love my new paperwhite. i had previously had a generation 1 and a generation 2 kindle. this is a tremendous step up. i usually use my kindles for reading on the beach. i love that it is small and fits in my beachbag or purse. i like the back light on it also. if i had to make one constructive criticism i would have liked the page turning to be more like turning the page on a book like the kindle app on my phone works. occasionally, if i don't hit the page turn in the right spot i get other ""stuff"" that shows up. not a huge deal but i would like it to be more intuitive in that regard.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
when i first opened the box, i was unsure as to my feelings about this new kindle. but, after learning to use it, the performance has been first rate. the variable brightness makes it easy on the eyes to read day or night.	Wired Headphones

like the fact that it is strictly an ereader. wished it was a bit larger like the fire hd 8 tablet but pleased with my purchase	Wired Headphones
the kindle paperwhite is an improvement over older generation kindle's with it's clearer display, cleaner font, and builtin light. it's an ereader that anyone can use with very little technical capability and makes for an enjoyable reading experience.	iPhone

i have had both the kindle and the nook ereader. they are similar in almost every way, with one big difference.amazon has more ebooks available, and they slightly cheaper.plus, then i bought the kindle, it was on sale for 99, making it the same price as the nook.	Apple Airpods Headphones

kindle makes reading easy, lightweight and the light makes reading much easier in low or no light.	USB-C Charging Cable

great product if you need to read ebooks, good battery life.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great gift as it's reasonably priced. battery life is fantastic. put it into airplane mode and it lasts even longer. don't forget this is the one where you have to adjust the backlight. if you want to auto adjust you need to get the voyager. both nice and compact. highly recommended.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i bought this ereader because i wanted to use it at the river and by the pool and still be able to see the screen in the sunlight. the kindle paperwhite didn't disappoint. compact and a step above the basic ereader.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

my wife had an older kindle but this one had so many improvements great paper white reading appearance, longer battery life, and it lights up so she can read in bed.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
an 'okay' reader. reading from an ipad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. plus, with the ipad you can play games, web search, etc. the kindle library function is not nearly as good as the kindle app on the ipad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the kindle. i also do not like the page turn of the kindle versus apple. every page turned on kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. i actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the kindle slow page turn. even the reading in the outdoors feature of the kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. the kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. the explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. it is worse on some of the devices i saw than on others. kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. i would never take an ipad to the beach, but the kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the ipad. if apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then i don't see any market for the kindle at that point. not sorry i have a kindle, but for what i decided to buy it for reading at beach it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. i still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i have always enjoyed my kindles. easy to carry and read.	USB-C Charging Cable
the screen is glare free and easy to read in any light. i love this kindle	Wired Headphones
hands down the best. i had a nook for years and rarely used it. i have already read 5 different books on the kindle and it's a much smoother experience.	iPhone
very happy with my product. best buy staff was extremely helpful	Bose SoundSport Headphones
first of all i would like to say that i'm very happy with my purchase. it is very helpful and useful gadgets for every single ebook reader. battery life is awesome and it's very stylish display and overall look. definitely must buy product.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i bought this for my wife and she loves it. lighter in weight, no glare. the white background is easier to read than the previous model she had.	USB-C Charging Cable
very good product. easy to read with the extra lightings. look wise it is good	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have been using kindle for several years now but my old one was starting to freeze and had problems connecting to the internet sometimes. this new one is a great replacement. i like that it is backlit and that it syncs to the latest page read with the kindle app on my iphone. great purchase.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use and clarity is wonderful! this was a present for my daughter and she loves it.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is my second pw and my 5th kindle over the years. i don't know of a better way to consume books. read on the kindle, catch up on the iphone, further on the ipad, and back to the kindle.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

exactly like my friends. i love it. i took it on vacation and great to read on the beach or at home	Lightning Charging Cable
easy to use and read with good battery life. highly recommend.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this kndle for my daughter who is vision impaired. i was able to increase the size of the print enough that she could read without a magnifying glass. she hadn't been able to read a book for many years so she was thrilled. it's also great that she is able to read with no glare on the screen if she is outside. great product!	Flatscreen TV
got this as a gift for my sister. she was running out of book shelf space this was the great idea. she loved this gift and it has a light so you can read this one in the dark.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
it's certainly better than the original kindle. the touchscreen is hard to get used to and it's easy to accidentally forward through several pages or chapters if you fall asleep with your finger on the screen. it is also difficult to look a word up in the dictionary if it's at the top of the screen because highlighting it brings the home screen. it is better viewing in light and because it has it's own light is much more convenient is the dark.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i was tired of trying to read my books on my regular kindle fire or my phone and never being able to do so because the screen was too dark or glare was to strong.this is my 3rd kindle and i love it the best! perfect indoors or outdoors. small and compact. fits easily in my purse or tote.	Lightning Charging Cable
i have been researching the different kindles, and decided on this one. i think i made a great choice.	27in FHD Monitor
love using my kindle paperwhite. the best feature is the ability to adjust the backlight when reading in different locations.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
does the job, especially at that price! after using colored tablets, it does take some time to get used to though.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great upgrade, with the touch screen but still with the perfect ability to read outside!set up is idiot proof and very quick. i like that you can have two accounts on it now, as my husband uses it also. has a very long battery life and is pretty rugged as i dropped a couple of times.if you love to read outside this is the product for you!	20in Monitor
bought as a gift for my 70yearold husband who reads a lot. he loves this way of reading books only accessible by kindle.	Lightning Charging Cable
this my 3rd kindle paper white. my other two are completely full of great reads my eyes are bigger than the number of hours in a day. i don't go anywhere without a kindle paperwhite in my purse jacket pocket, etc because it's so compact and easy to adjust the size of the print if necessary.

the paperweight is a fantastic ereader and the best i've ever used. great display, fantastic battery life, and a very adjustable front light system work together to create an amazing reading experience. the only thing i would change would be to make it water and dust resistant for beach use. which is rumored to be coming in the next modelthe ability to borrow ebooks from my library and download them directly on my kindle is fantastic!	Vareebadd Phone

i've had my kindle for a few weeks now and find it very easy to cart around and to read regardless of the lighting situation. i'm not crazy about the constant ads for books in genres i'm not at all interested in, but that's about the only negative i've found so far.	Lightning Charging Cable

would encourage others to purchase if they are avid readers, can go anywhere	iPhone
this is the best ereader in the market, the battery last a least 4 weeks with one charged	Lightning Charging Cable
i absolutely love the kindle paperwhite! it is my first ereader but it's won me over! i had to choose between the kindle and the nook. each had it's advantages and the only reason that the kindle won out was because of my obsessive usage of amazon. i don't like that it uses a proprietary format other formats are usable such as pdf. but there are workarounds out there.the screen is crisp and looks just like paper. i barely notice the eink refreshing and i can read for hours without discomfort. the built in light is great for night reading and it's so light!overall, a great device and if you can wait there are price drops fairly often.910. would buy again.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the paper white kindle is great. makes reading in the dark is so much easier.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

before i switched to the kindle white i was using barnes and noble nook which had several down sides compared to the kindle. kindle battery last a long time compared to the nook. kindle does not jump pages like the nook. nook is very sensitive to touch and causes a lot of confusion when trying to find where you left off reading. my husband and i are very happy that we switched to kindle especially since you have a greater selection of reading material through amazon.	iPhone
this is my first kindle and i love it. i have used it every day since i bought it.	Wired Headphones

i just love the size of the kindle and it's easy to take on the go. perfect reading for outdoors on the deck around the pool.	USB-C Charging Cable
we started out great. we had a great thing going. i loved her, she was easy on the eyes, and looked great in any light. then 7 months into it, i could no longer turn her on. i tried the reboot with no luck. she is still under warranty but that doesn't matter because best buy's return policy stinks. if i do try to replace her, i will not buy it here.	Wired Headphones

my girlfriend is a bookwork and she absolutely loves her kindle paperwhite. we tried getting the standard kindle first, but that just didn't do it for her as she likes to read in the dark as well. the paperwhite was the perfect investment for her, and i'm considering getting one for myself.	Flatscreen TV
perfect for those of us who don't want to buy books and really prefer not to carry a stack from the library. once i got the hang of it, books were easy to load from our local library. the kindle is easy to hold and i can adjust the page brightness and type size as needed. would not get though if you want to see color pictures in books.	Flatscreen TV
the perfect reader you need if you choose to read everywhere	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
had a very, very old kindle so this was quite a change. like the size, the paperwhite didn't think i would and the backlighting.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great value. it doesn't hurt my eyes. so easy to use and upload books. best of all my kids wont try and use it to surf the web.	Wired Headphones
this is the second kindle paperwhite we have purchased for one of our grand children. this is a great tool to promote reading for kids or adults. this tool combined with amazon's available online subscriptions or purchasing books individually is the way to go.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
works well. a nice upgrade from our old one. easy to use	Flatscreen TV
if you like to read but don't want a lot of clutter, or just don't have the space for dozens of books on your shelf then this is the solution. the layout is simple to use and the screen is perfect. reading in direct sunlight isn't an issue thanks to the matte finish of the eink display. the battery on this thing will outlast any other electronic you have in your house.my only complaintissue is that as a avid reader off comic books, this device thanks to the nature of the display don't allow me to enjoy my favorite medium.	ThinkPad Laptop
i take this on all my trips. i have access to,tons of books. i can carry it in my purse and read wherever i am.	USB-C Charging Cable
i like the convenience of my kindle a lot for reading, and the process for buying books from amazon is easy and flawless, as well as cheaper than buying physical books. there are a lot of 1.99 specials of very good books. i just wish the kindle was slightly larger more the size of a typical paperback book because when i'm reading it feels like i'm ""turning"" a page every few seconds.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
extremely easy to view. no light needed. just what i was looking for.	Apple Airpods Headphones

i had previously purchased the first kindle fire for reading but i would get distracted with all those other apps you can get on it. when the kindle paper white came out i decided ill give it a try. i love reading in the dark with it and that it looks like the pages in a physical book. i also love the word wise it helps to review words you didnt know later if you want, growing your vocabulary.

lightweight, fits perfectly in my hands, good screen quality. makes reading even more enjoyable.	iPhone
i simply love it. at first i thought reading black and white content on a ipad would be a similar experience and reading on ipad or iphone is similar and no need for kindle. but kindle is different and for me it's better than reading a physical book. it's so cool to carry around thousands of books at any time. battery goes on and on and on. excellent piece of hardware.	Wired Headphones
i love being able to download books and read them whenever i want. i carry it in my purse and can read it anytime i'm in a situation where i'm waiting, on the bus, etc. it's much more convenient than carrying a book around. the only thing that i'd improve is making it easier to get the homepagetoolbar to display.

the screen was small for me and i couldn't access a website with free ebooks. i ended up taking it back and read on my ipad now.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i was very hesitant on buying an ereader as i didn't think spending 100 on a device that i would then need to spend on books was worth it. now that i have been using the paperwhite, there are plenty of free books available to download. it is very easy to read in every lighting condition that i've used it in so far. wish i would have bought it much sooner.

i am on my 3rd kindle. this software downloads new purchases with a picture of the cover of the book on my homepage. only about a fifth of the available space. so this would only allow you to buy at most four books at a time before the covers would be too small. the new books should be downloaded to my library in list form as in the original kindle. in addition, once you have looked at a book in the homepage, it disappears and you have to search for it or place it in a category. finally, this system disallows you from manipulating books the way you want. this os is definitely not user friendly. it requires a great deal of effort of the user. a lot of wasted data space and waste of time. i am requesting a return to the original kindle os.

i loved my book covers and the feeling of a book in my hands. but after reading countless reviews i gave in and bought a kindle. now i can't imagine reading without it. after tons of booklights that died on me and heavy books that never fit in my bag. i can read anywhere, anytime, and in any lighting. i only wish the kindle store was not so biased to kindle unlimited. it doesn't list the top books it lists people who pay the be on there. so you don't get genuine recommendations. still, i will never read the same again. if you want to look up the mean of the word merely click it, if you want to make the font bigger you can do so, and if you want to see better raise the brightness. it's so much easier on the eyes than reading on my ipad.

i travel extensively for work and recently had stopped carrying books to cut down on bulk in my carryons. a sale pushed me into finally buying a kindle and it has been a great purchase for me. the screen is extremely easy to read, has almost too much granularity in brightness settings, and is visible in all lighting conditions. the ability to add library ebooks is also a huge convenience for being able to read new books, in addition to buying direct from amazon.	Lightning Charging Cable
amazing battery life and beautiful screen. my friend i are all like it.	Product
lightweight ereader with backlight. works as advertised.	Google Phone
plan to use the kindle paperwhite on a cruise so very important that we could use it in the sun.	Wired Headphones
i wanted to upgrade my 3rd gen kindle keyboard to one with a backlight. the paper white is a great device to read on. the backlight and improved screen resolution make a big difference. there's a few software features i'd like amazon to add but nothing that inhibits me from using the kindle. if you've been thinking of upgrading or jumping into the kindle for the first time, i'd highly recommend the paper white.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i just love my paperwhite! the size is small enough to fit in my purse and pull out whenever i have the time. the charge lasts forever, so i'm not always looking to plug in. i love that i can sit outside and read, or in bed at night, without light on to disturb husband. i belong to a book club, so it's nice to be able to add notes when i want to and to have the dictionary right there if needed. i can hook right onto amazon, goodreads or borrow from the library while sitting in bed. this is my first kindle, so i don't have stuff to compare it to but i sure love this one.

works great in bright sunlight, used it at the beach	Wired Headphones

i bought this kindle as a gift for my brother. i already have one and love it so much i wanted him to have one too.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i replaced my old kindle with this one. the pull out light on the old one had been damaged by my grand son. this kindle is so much smaller, lighter and the lighting makes it much easier to read. i got the cover that makes it look like a small notepad since i was traveling to guatemala.	Wired Headphones
i bought the kindle fire not to long ago but wasn't happy with it because of the glare and lack of a backloght which hurt my eyes. i was hesitant to but another kindle but im glad i did! this is exactly what i needed to replace the fire. it's a little small but so much better than what i had before	Lightning Charging Cable

AA Batteries (4-pack)
we bought two kindle paperwhites and we just love them! i love the size and portability of them. one of them was for our kids so that when we travel we don't have to bring a bunch of books in the car, it's all on one little device and frees up so much space in the car!	Lightning Charging Cable
i've had a number of kindles since inception and this one is fantastic. the back lighting works great and the device is responsive, light, and agile. i wish there was a way to delete ads after you've bought the device	Macbook Pro Laptop
this is my first ereader. the screen has a nice feel to it. it reads really well. i don't like the fact that amazon has total control of your purchases. i do not like the amazon free unlimited book trial. they don't allow access to certain titles. so far i am able to find most of my book selections. i will be creating my own reading lists and want zero input from amazon. the battery life seams to be awesome. of course when you shut it off ads pop up. the kindle claims that it doesn't take up battery to display these ads. but they seem to mysteriously change on their own even when it is turned off strange. it is super nice that you can read in the dark with this one. kindle paperwhite i like the fact it is small enough to carry around in a purse, yet big enough to read.the font is adjustable too, if you need bigger letters.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
kindle paperwhite is great for reading any time, day or night without needing a light!. and any where, beach, bed, airplanes. so much more convenient, i.e. better, than carrying a book, or several books!	AA Batteries (4-pack)

i had two kindles previously, i think 3rd gen white one with keyboard, cheapest kindle i won couple years back from a raffle, and finally purchased this paper white. so much easier on my eyes and my wife doesn't get bothered by a little bit of light it produces. i was a casual reader who reads one book every quarter and with paper white i read 12 books a month minimum.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

kindle paperwhite comes with back light so it can be reader without enough light source. since it uses eink, it can be read under bright light. moreover, it is not costly at all.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
we have various versions of the kindle and this one is great. the screen quality is amazing and i think it makes this the best kindle paperwhite, and the price is great got it for less than a 100 with a best buy member deal	Google Phone
very happy with this purchase which replaced a 3rd generation unit. much easier on the eyes and very responsive to the touch. takes a little to get used of the page fowardbackward on this device but no big deal. the reviews on best buy site were very instrumental in making this purchase.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i have been reading my kindle books on my phone for a few years now but the light from the phone was causing eye strain and i could not read for very long. that is no longer a problem using the kindle. i was concerned about the lighting on it but it works great. it is adjustable for low and high light settings and i can read as long as i like with no eye strain. i use it every day!	Apple Airpods Headphones
the kindle paperwhite was well worth the upgrade from my previous kindle ereader. the touch screen capability makes it so much handier than turning pages and navigating with buttons, and the lighted display lets me sit and read wherever i like. these features use up battery a bit faster than the basic model, but recharging more frequently is not so bad considering the conveniences gained. i noticed one bothersome quirk, which is the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. sometimes it jumps ahead more than one page when i touch to turn. checking online, i see that i'm not the only one experiencing this problem. if it continues or becomes more bothersome, i will contact amazon customer service for a solution.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i am very satisfied with it. it is exactly what i was looking for.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
got it for my wife and she loves it. very convenient for travel.	Google Phone
the kindle paperwhite is reliable, holds a charge for weeks, is lightweight and easy to hold, allows you to read in bed at night without eye strain or bothering anyone because of the backlit surface, and stores hundreds of books. what can i say? i love my kindle, and this one was the second i have bought.this one as a gift for an elderly parent. she loves it! the font is easy to adjust for people who need large print. i take my kindle everywhere so i am never bored whether i am waiting in the doctor's office or stuck in an airport overseas.

in an effort to simply and cut down on the number of books i shelve and store i bought the paper white kindle by amazon. i had previously owned a fire and it fatigued my eyes after reading and like my books ended up on a shelf. my parents swear by their kindle paper white's and so i decided to give it a try!i love it! easy to read, easy on the eyes, i can read it in bed without keeping my wife awake, super lite and the battery lasts forever!

i have a cell, a tablet, and now my 4th ? kindle. i did not want to but this one because the only problem i had with my last one was that something happened to the charging port.i.e., it wouldn't charge.but, i will will always have a kindle because the battery lasts soooooooooo much longer than the battery on my cell and my tablet. i've been taken to task because i have all three and according to my critics that is a waste. my choice.get over it.

we bought this kindle for our son. he's moving up in the high school years and more books are required for reading so instead of buying books or waiting for availability at the local library it was the smart choice. download and read!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i love the paperwhite and we have had kindles in the house for years. this paperwhite is as snappy as the voyage and while it doesn't have that smooth glass screen, it also doesn't have the extra 100 or so price tag. it's a great piece of tech that often goes on sale. get it when it does. it's well worth it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this since it has a special discount for elite plus members	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought it for my son for his summer reading. kindle is working great.	Apple Airpods Headphones
for the price, the kindle paperwhite was a great upgrade to the old kindle. the back light was a plus when using on a plane, and the charged lasted throughout the two week trip.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i was pretty hesitant at first when looking to purchase a kindle. there is just something about having a physical book in your hands while reading and seeing the progress in how far you've gotten into the book. being a person who is always reading on the go, at work, and in the dark at home when others are sleeping, the kindle has been awesome.	Lightning Charging Cable
very good reading gadget. delivers all i need. size and shape good for take anywhere.	Wired Headphones
it took me a while to break down and finally buy a digital book, i'm a big fan of paper books. i love the kindle so far! i wanted an ereader that i could only read books on, no apps or games, that's what my phone is for, and so far i am very happy	20in Monitor

taking some time to figure it all out but i love it!	Wired Headphones
if you like to read books, i totally recommend this product. i love reading books and the kindle paperwhite really helps. i used to read books on the ipad all the time but it would strain my eyes. after reading all the reviews i decided it was finally time to get a ereader. since i had my ipad already i just needed one to strictly read books, so i got the paperwhite. it is so nice to read from especially in the sun. it's almost like reading from the actual book. it's the perfect size to read in one hand and stores so many books, even some for my child. it's also great for traveling. i have all my books on hand no matter where i go. there are only two cons to the paperwhite. one is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an ipad. at times it doesn't register my swipes or taps. the other con is that it's only black and white. it really isn't a problem when i'm reading, just for the children's books.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my second kindle reader. my first one wasn't back lite. i love that i can read outside in the sunshine or in bed with no light on. it is a great item if you like to read. i haven't bought an actual book in years!	Apple Airpods Headphones

it's easy to carry and super device for all books.	Lightning Charging Cable
gave as a gift to my wife. she loves the size. good battery life. now needs to find a cover for it.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i had the original kindle for years and when it finally crashed i was heartbroken. i don't like to change once i get used to something so having to go out and buy a new kindle was hard but i need my books. the paperwhite is great because the light is built in so i didn't need to hunt down a lighted cover. the reason i went with the paperwhite is because i can't read with my glasses on it gives me a headache and that model you are still able to adjust the font.it works great in sunlight i read on beach for 2 days while on vacation. it transfered all my books from the old kindle as soon as i registered it also so i still have my library.i am glad to say after being skeptical of change it was a great decission.

i bought this as an upgrade to the kindle fire that i bought my wife 3 years ago. she says that it is easier to read and loves the smaller size.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle because it's so convenient when i want a new book. i can download it right away from the device and even check out books from the library. the battery lasts a long time. i've only charged it twice since i've had it and i read almost every night. i keep it on airplane mode to conserve extra battery.	27in FHD Monitor
while reading might be a bit easier on the paperwhite, navigating on it drove me nuts. the touch screen is annoying and has limited functionality. i tried to like it. i just couldn't. it's sitting unused while i use a less expensive fire.	27in FHD Monitor
love the compact size, ease to read, ability to easily access library and back lighting makes this a great product.	Apple Airpods Headphones

the kindle paperweight is a nice sized tablet good for reading in any lighting. you're able to see it in the bright sun light as well as the dim lit room	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
there is nothing else left on the eink market anyway but the amazon kindle. it still doesn't support epub format of course, amazon doesn't like competition. it is built ok, moderately cheap plastic, but no squeaking at least. contrast is ok, i had nook and it is on par. i can't imagine how bad the regular kindle would be though. this one with 300 dpi is just ok. scrolling is fast enough, it has integrated vocabulary. no home menu or other physical buttons though, besides the home kindle one the ui is not completely responsive when you try to go to your library, instead home brings you to amazon kindle page, where you are overwhelmed with advertisement.my biggest dislike is the volume of advertisement and thus the convoluted interface. it is way worse then nook, which is much more readingcentric.a lot of cheap and free books are available on amazon, especially with prime membership. it can be linked to public library for ebooks as well.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle is everything i expected it to be and fits all the needs that i had of this item	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is perfect for those that just want to read books anytime, anywhere! great battery life.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

best reader i think for the price. the only thing amazon needs to work on is the user experience. make it a little easier to use.	Apple Airpods Headphones
extremely easy to use and to purchase. the touch screen works well and the auto onoff is very helpful. love the ability to just close and system is off and not using battery.	Google Phone

would prefer hardware buttons and wish you could access public library digital book. other than that works great in the dark.	Apple Airpods Headphones

i broke my kindle voyage after almost two years. my heart was as broken as the glass cover!after looking at the latest line of kindles i decided to try the latest paperwhite as it had the same screen resolution and was a lot cheaper. plus, a white model to match my other whitesilver gadgets! it does have a few less leds for backlighting, no flush glass cover but that is what broke, no autoadjusting light that never quite worked anyway, squeezy sides, and a tiny bit heavierbigger than the voyage. the voyage also has had no hardware updates since it was released and the new crazyexpensive kindle uses leather and has no notleather option for people who don't like their high tech wrapped in animal skins. so instead of saving up for a while and reading on my phone, i sprung for the paperwhite.i've been using this for about a month and the quality has impressed me. i don't miss the glass cover as much as i thought i would, although sometimes pet hair will get caught between the bezel and the screen and need to be pulled out. the screen is great, doesn't clash with the white casing, and although not quite as even a backlight as the voyage, still much better value for what you get. the software is essentially the same, and amazon has been slowly improving kindle software for all the recent models.if you like amazon for books, i highly recommend this kindle. you can't beat it for pricevalue and it really doesn't feel any heavier even after an hour or two curled up with your books.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my husband prefers the paperwhite model over the voyager because it is easier for him to hold in his big fat fingers since it has a larger frame so more room for the fingers. and kindle paperwhite and voyager models are much easier to read for long hours than tablets easier on the eyes. i have an ipad and still have a kindle for reading. i highly recommend the kindle paperwhite and voyager models.	Flatscreen TV
absolutely love it! battery life lasts long and great screen with the back light.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i love the paper while kindle. i can read at night without a table light on.	Lightning Charging Cable
i did not think i would prefer an ereader to an actual book, but i do. it is easy to read, easy to pause, east to start back. i do feel that it is a little awkward to hold and ill be ordering a leather cover case.	USB-C Charging Cable
was reviewing offers across all the sites and ended buying from bestbuy. service was fast as expected. product was packed properly.	Lightning Charging Cable
i'm not big reader. since the purchase, i have been reading a lot more! even recipies! i love this kindle! my boyfriend bought one the exact same time, then bought some cute cases for them.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a very good item and i would recommend highly.	Lightning Charging Cable
love my kindie paperwhite it's light weight and small enough to carry in my purse.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great item, i read in the dark without strain and never disturb my wife's sleep, user friendly and durable. i've not been a reader until now, have several books but it's at night when i have time to read but have to have a light on, this has been the game changer. two thumbs up!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i spent a lot of time resisting the kindle and using the app on my ipad but i took the plunge on the paperwhite for a long trip i wanted to use my ipad for tv while reading. the paperwhite is crisp, you can read it through day and night and downloads books with a quickness. i never would have thought such a simple device ended up taking priority over everything on my list of travel gear.whether i'm on a redeye or sitting on my back porch in the day, i can see the text comfortably and crisply. really love this reader. don't cheap out on the one without the backlight!	USB-C Charging Cable
i got this for my teenage ""son"" who has really gotten into reading. the device is durable and easy to use. he is really happy to take a pile of books with him wherever he goes.	Google Phone
i got this as a gift for my mom. she loves it. i highly recommend it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
we have been looking into buying it for kids for some time and they love it	Wired Headphones
i wanted to avoid the excessive blue light created by ipads, phones, and other color electronic devices. this lets me read right up till bedtime with no problems.	20in Monitor
i like the reduced size, the touchscreen and the builtin light of kindle peperwhite. but i used to have a kindle 2nd edition device, which supported background music and audible content.	ThinkPad Laptop
great for reading! light is perfect and does not hurt your eyes. if you are always on the go the kindle is for you!	Wired Headphones
i purchased it for a gift but i have to do all the up keep and maintaining. i've been a long time prime member who has many kindle books. i see this can be good for reading out side, it's lighter than a tablet and you don't have to charge it alot, the battery lasts a long time.setup is straight forward and doesnt take alot of instruction to use it. it displays adds while its off, but it didn't bother me at all. it took me but a few minutes to setup and learn how to use the device.if you have prime you should see all your books right away but if you don't have prime but have someone in your house that does you have to setup a household and share everything to my wife so she was able to see all the books that i had purchased i can be selective after they are shared. one thing i noticed was there is the kindle lending library, it only allows 1 book to be borrowed per month. recently amazon came up with prime reading, so you can take out multiple books at a time but you have to do it thru the web or a tablet or phone using the kindle app, which after they are taken out the kindle will see.	Lightning Charging Cable
i prefered reading actual books over reading digitally, because the screen made my eyes hurt. however, the kindle paperwhite isn't designed like a regular digital reader, it so different. i could read it for hours and my eyes won't hurt.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
great gift for my daughter. she's a big time reader, it saves a lot of space and money.	Vareebadd Phone
my first kindle. really like it. glad i bought it!	Lightning Charging Cable
for those who truly just want an ereader, the kindle gets the job done. no glare , easy to use.	Wired Headphones

very easy and comfortable to use, almost use it every day. i would recommend this to anyone loves a book.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i had a kindle 2 and liked it for years. the paperwhite is much smaller, but with a bigger screen. the backlight feature is fantastic!	Lightning Charging Cable
i absolutely love the kindle paperwhite. the battery life is great reading a half hour to an hour a day it lasts 23 weeks. screen backlight is very easy on the eyes and adjustable in brightness. this is one of my best tech purchases.	27in FHD Monitor
i love my kindle! i have gotten so spoiled that if i can't get a book on my kindle, i don't read it.	USB-C Charging Cable
for those of us that truly just want to read literature and do not necessarily need to browse the web this is a must have.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

great kindle for everyone who loves to read highly recommend and what i like is you can enlarge print to fit your needs.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
paper white is worth every penny! i was upgrading from the regular kindle to this and noticed that my eyes are more relaxed.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
nice item. only drawback, occasional pauses upon turning page or creating bookmark.	Macbook Pro Laptop
it came with loaded advertisement is the only negative.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
very convenient, perfect size and easy on the eyes. i never though i would stop reading paperbacks, but this makes reading a library of different books much more convenient.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great for reading in bright sunlight or night settings. must for avid readers.	Lightning Charging Cable
those who enjoy reading! has great life span on the battery and enjoy having access to a interior light for easy reading.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
had glitches and screentouch sensitivity issues with the previous kindle the basic kindle however, this is definitely worth the cost for an upgrade above it. very user friendly and hassle free.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the paperwhite is so much easier to use than the classic kindle. the back light touch screen are definitely worth the upgrade.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
not for the average computer person. very confusing instructions. i spent several hours trying to install the ""overdrive"" so i could get ebooks from the library. ran the battery down several times with no luck. i got so disgusted i had to just put it down. i'm still trying because i refuse to give up thinking about just returning it and the nice leather case too!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great for reading in sunlight. lightweight and battery lasts a long time!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i've had every kindle since they came out and have been impressed by the innovation, design, and overall quality. this one is the exception on all counts. lightning issues on the bottom of the reader are distracting and i don't see a visible difference from the older models. evidently, production is of higher value than quality.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is now my third kindle reader. i have been exceedingly impressed with them. the paper white is the best so far. so happy that i no longer need the bulky clip on lights to read at night!	Wired Headphones
this is my second kindle .second paper white bought for my niece. love the ease of reading without the distractions you get on tablets	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i always read books on paper and thought it would not be the same to use a kindle, but now i'm totally happy with it. thanks to it now i read more when commuting, traveling, . as it is a very handy and light product.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it is highly recommended for someone who loves reading. easy set up, lots of books to download.i have ipad, but this beats reading experience hands down.one downside is that the new kindle paperwhite has lower battery life compared to it's previous generation. hence only 4 star.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is great tablet for reading purpose. easy to download, surf and read the desired books with great text quality. on top of that, it comes with affordable price.	Apple Airpods Headphones
very good device for reading. love the screen. makes reading easy and comforatble	27in FHD Monitor

super light and love the color. very easy too carry around	ThinkPad Laptop
very easy to use. very convenient and lightweight.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle works great for reading outdoors while enjoying the summer weather. my wife loves that font size can be increased so she doesn't need her reading glasses. the kindle automatically adjusts to light. weather inside or out the kindle is always easy to read. opens books right where you left off, regardless of the number of books you read at one time. highly recommend.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use,battery lasts forever, and compatible with public library downloads to amazon	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
preferred my old style and size because the new style did not fit withyour old case that was new	27in FHD Monitor
i own a business in finance and need to read a lot on varied subjects. the kindle enables me to find referenced books and download them in a few seconds. i haven't tried but apparently you can even upload your own pdfs. the fonts and screen resolution and lighting are extremely pleasant, and it is easier to hold than a book. i removed 1 star because the highlighting and note taking systems can get laggy, images are sometimes hard to zoom on, and you can't copy paste a quote. but overall because of the access and convenience it offers i highly recommend it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i am very pleased with the paper white kindle e reader. love the back up light as i can read no matter what lighting i'm in. the only drawback for me is there is no text to speech. please bring that back!	27in FHD Monitor
i bought this kindle paperwhite for my wife for her birthday. she doesn't always have an easy time with technology, so i wanted to make sure that it was simple to use. the paperwhite was very easy to set up and she downloaded two books the first day, one from the library and one purchased. she now takes it everywhere with her and loves it. mission accomplished.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
perfect size, easily readable screen, and crisp text.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great expirience reading from a devicegood for your eyes	34in Ultrawide Monitor
much better than it he earlier kindles no more messing with lights	Apple Airpods Headphones
it would be nice if it had a text list of books, like my old kindle. the cover graphics are too small to read. this is the only reason for four stars, and not five. other than that, i like this better because of the great resolution and contrast, as well as the built in led's for reading at night.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is the greatest reader! its super light weight, fast at downloading books and very user friendly. i have charged it once in the 2 months i have had it. excellent battery life.	USB-C Charging Cable
the greatest kindle i have ever owned, would be great for kids also	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love the fact, i can read in bed at night, and the backlight is adjustable so it does not bother my husband sleeping. only negative is it takes a few longer seconds then i would like to power off.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i hate this machine. first, i specifically asked the salesperson if i could connect to the internet. he assured me i could. it does not. second complaint is that you can't just press the book and delete it. you have to go to amazon to do this. i hated it so much i gave it away.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i like this reader. it is very easy to load books onto it, even from my local library. it's easy to adjust the font and size. it keeps track of your place in the book. you can choose what language you want the dictionary in which makes it great to read something in a foreign language. you can set it up so that when you select a word, it will give you the translation.	Wired Headphones
purchased to replace an older model that died during a software update lost wifi connection during the download, bricking the kindle. this model has 300dpi, up from 220 on the previous model. with text it is barely, if at all, noticeable. with any kind of graphics or cover images, the increase in resolution is nicer. unfortunately the lighting remains uneven at the bottom of the screen as it was in the previous generation. the voyager model supposedly has better lighting but at twice the price it wasn't worth it to me. and the uneven bottom lighting isn't bad, but it is there and i would have thought amazon would have fixed that by now. maybe it is a limitation of having 4 light sources vs the 6 on the voyager. still, the lighting is not bad and this is a very nice ereader. noticed the background is a touch more beige than the grey on the previous model which is a welcome subtle change, easier on the eyes. like too that the font is a dark grey versus pitch black which also reduces eye strain especially for those with dyslexia who can be sensitive to harsh contrasts. overall, highly recommended. best ereader for the price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
got this for my wife. uses it everyday and performs great regardless of where your reading just like it's suppose to	Macbook Pro Laptop
this kindle is great. customer service rep for technical questionsnot so much.	USB-C Charging Cable
the screen is cool. much better than the basic kindle. very similar to the kindle voyage. if you want a really reading experience, you need a kindle.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is my third one, don't use anything else for reading books.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this kindle for a friend. in fact, it's the third kindle i have purchased for friends. it's light and can be used at the beach or in the dark. it's easy to use and worth the money.	Lightning Charging Cable

i love this item because my three children can use it ages 11 to 15. the screen is fenomenal.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
we still have one of the original kindles, and the upgraded features on the new kindle are great being able to change the brightness, able to read it in the dark, seeing page numbers in addition to completed. this kindle seemed easier to use and more intuitive than the original.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i was attracted by the price of the base kindle but in the end opted for the paperwhite as it was illuminated and had rounded edges which felt more comfortable. definitely worth the extra few dollars in my opinion. my local library offers free loans of ebooks which i have been taking advantage of. there are also many free books online samples and classics with expired copyrights. battery life is good and the device is lightweight. even in bright ambient light you get minimal screen glare. i prefer this to a physical book which i never expected.	USB-C Charging Cable
loved it. perfect type of lighting and so lightweight!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have had a paperwhite kindle before and i wore it out. i love the paperwhite so much i bought another one. its my 3rd kindle. loved them all. no better way then to read with the paperwhite and not bother your bed mate.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my dad because he loves to read but, sometimes, it's difficult to get to the library in the winter. so far, he's loving it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great device for reading books. i was using a tablet for that but the screen on this is far easier on your eyes for long extended use.	Wired Headphones
this kindle is awesome! put off getting one for way too long. light weight and cute. fits in a purse or bag and you hardly know it is there. reading is simple and easy. downloading books is a breeze! don't hesitate to get this kindle. you will love it.	Flatscreen TV
i didn't need to review the product because i alread had one. i purchased the kindle for my wife for our anniversary and she loves it. the best part is you can read it outside in the bright sun or inside .we rarely buy paper books anymore!	Wired Headphones
battery life is excellent. lasts days. no glare when reading outside	27in FHD Monitor
it is my first ereader then i cannot compare it with others. however, in comparison to tablets, the most importance thing is you enjoy reading your book without any eyestrain.	Lightning Charging Cable
i purchased it with a discounted price and now it seems pretty worthy and durable. kindle's the best and most comfortable ereader for my everyday use. i love it and put it in my bag everyday.	USB-C Charging Cable
i used to read on my ipad, this is so much better on my eyes and lighter to hold.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
wife is happy. as they say happy wife, happy life.	ThinkPad Laptop
i prefer the deficated ereaders to tablets for reading. i have both this paoerwhite and a currentgen nook glow light. i really like the glow light especially its rugged construction and i still use it, but the paperwhite is better.the glow light has no bevel and a touchsensitive button on the front. this means i am constantantly turning the page or returing to the home screen by accident. it's very annoying, and i have a hard time finding a comfortable way to hold it. it seems like i'm always thinking about where my fingers are. i do not have this problem at all on the paperwhite.the paperwhite is a great little reader for the money. i would definitely buy another.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
have basic kindle and operation of paperwhite is much different, catching on as i use it. nice unit.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

as expected, light and easy to carry around. also easy to order books with an amazon account	34in Ultrawide Monitor
kindle is still the top ereader. my first one finally ""wore"" out from years of daily use. it was so light to hold and to travel with. battery life was great and it was so easy to read in daylight. this updated model is so much better. the backlight is a great improvement and is such a delight to use at night while reading in bed. this basic model is really all you need for reading books	Apple Airpods Headphones
this was purchased to replace a 1st generation kindle. the paperwhite is far superior to my old kindle, display is easier to read in any lighting scenario and page turning is much better.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's small enough to fit in my purse with ease. the back lighting works well in darker areas and i just love using it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
small, compact and perfect for travel. able to be read while the sun is shining directly on it.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this is the kindle to buy. great resolution and a backlight is great. the higher end kindle's don't justify the price difference. use it all time time and love it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i'm very happy with this kindle. is light and easy to carry everywhere. i like to read at nights and this is way better than having a light on.	ThinkPad Laptop

the kindle paperwhite arrived on time. the screen looks sharper compared to regular kindle.	Lightning Charging Cable
the main criticismfeedback i have about all electronics has to do with batteries. i feel all batteries could be replaceable rechargeable, of course. this is not always the case. so, unless electronic recycling is available, feasible nondamaging to the planet that's a bit of a blow. i still feel, technology is great this is no exception. downloading nonkindle items is a little more involved but still possible. i've used like the feature of downloading my own documents. i've done more reading than i have in many months due to the kindle. it's easy to read anywhere. font size back lighting are adjustable which creates an ideal reading situation, regardless of circumstances. wasn't sure about the size 6"" after reading 45 books the size is perfect in my hand.

i got this for my girlfriend and she loves it! the paperwhite version makes the screen look like you are reading an actual book. also,there are a lot of ebook deals daily and she definitely loves that aspect of having a kindle too.	Wired Headphones
still adjusting.had kindle fire and liked the ease of touch for turning pages, definitions and location in book. paper weight is much more difficult to maneuver, doesn't seem to be as touch sensitive as the fire. i have to repeatedly touch screen to get page to turn and definition accessibility also takes more work. also, bookmarking doesn't seem to stay on page.

my wife has a regular tablet but screen is not good for outside reading at the beach or pool. got her thekindle paperwhite and she is thrilled. great purchase!	Apple Airpods Headphones

at first i bought this because i was tired of carrying heavy cookbooks but turns out its better suited for more noveltype books. i realized that cookbooks need to be 'flippable' where i can just sit and flip back and forth. however this is great if you have long flights often light and easy on the eyes. i love being able to change the brightness easily	Wired Headphones
having a new kindle is always nice but not much is improved.	Wired Headphones
contemplated getting a kindle paperwhite for several months before purchasing. my kindle paperwhite is fantastic! it is lightweight, easy to handle, and worth every penny i paid for it. the first thing i did was download free books i never had the opportunity to read. mainly classics, books on philsophy, government, and leadership. i love that i can take it with me and read to my heart's content. made a great decision when i made this purchase.

bought for my friends, but good enough! why need so many comments?	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
as a book snobpurist i put off buying a kindle for ages. after doing a lot of travelling and lugging around paperbacks, i decided it was time to grow up and get over it. while it may not have the satisfaction of turning a physical page, it makes up for it by weighing practically nothing, only having to have one hand free and being able to read it outdoors. battery life is amazing will last over a month with moderate use. have been trying to convince all the other book lovers in my family to get one!.	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased the reader for my wife to replace her old reader. the old reader was the 1st edition. the paperwhite is amazing. it is much lighter and the page is much clearer. my wife is an avid reader and really loves her kindle.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
great product. love that i can download kindle unlimited and read for 9.99 per month.a great savings.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this makes reading really easy! great gift for the book reader in your life.	Wired Headphones
i like the paper white for reading because it doesn't have the glare like all the tablets with color and it makes reading feel like you are reading from a paper book without all the weight	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
my first tablet! i was surprised it's just like my samsung phone, and actually can sync programs and data with it. the wireless is great i have no need for cell capabilities. it would be more power usage to search for cell, and most places i can use wifi. i use it as an alternative kindle reader with the kindle app. i also was amazed to find a free microsoft office word, powerpoint, and excel, etc, although i haven't used them. this tab a is sometimes kind of slow, but it was about 100 on sale, and great for the price. very versatile. i'm very happy with it. i haven't needed extra memory yet, but good to know i can expand it with a microsd card.

i will buy another one. very convenient and portable.	Wired Headphones
bought for wife because i had one. hers was an older kindle that was about to fail.	Macbook Pro Laptop

this is the best gift a reader can receive. easy to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
i would recommend this to you. this product is really light and portable. you can carry it to caf or library for reading. there is no harm to your eyes because of it specific technology. the only drawback is that it will flash when you turn the page. but this is the common problem for this kind of reading stuff. i think it is acceptable. i bought on the price of 99 with a 25 discount. so it really worth it.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
best electronic reader. the base kindle is hard to read because the lack of light and the other readers and apps just don't offer the quality experience and feel of the kindle paperwhite.	Apple Airpods Headphones

i bought this for one of my friends who loves reading books. i have to say this product is wonderful because it looks like real paper. very comfortable reading experience. it is also very light, beyond my expectation. i recommend this.	Wired Headphones

i purchased as a replacement ereader to my alurek. i could not download ebooks on to my new macbook and do not want to read books on my macbook. i love the size, feel and back light of the paper white. glad i purchased it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i mean it's a great product for what you get, little on the expensive side	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i am so glad i purchased the paperwhite. it makes reading better at night because of little glare and dimmer than my fire or ipad. was finding it hard to justify buying it but i'm really glad i did!	Wired Headphones
i had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the kindle voyage. but the only difference between the two is the design, page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen. after purchasing this device, i immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend. which, sadly, is more than i've read in about two years. this device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while. i would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase. overall, i would recommend anyone that wants to read more, reads often, or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device. plus, new books can be upwards of 2030 sometimes. this little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books. plus if you need a physical copy, you can always borrow from the library.	Lightning Charging Cable
i love this tablet. it is great for indoor reading as well as outdoors. the back lighting makes it ideal for indoor spaces that are not well lit.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
great with no or low light, good battery life syncs easy	USB-C Charging Cable
the kindle paperwhite is easy to use and great for reading outdoors.	Wired Headphones
we have had a kindle fire for years. my wife used it exclusively for reading. she grew frustrated of the constant random reboots and difficulty to see the screen. this device has cured all those issues. longer battery life, stable hardware, and ease of viewing make this a winner.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i've had several kindles in the past. really love the paperwhite because of the light and being able to read outside	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great for outside reading. my ipad has been good too with the kindle app but can't see well in bright light. this fixes that.	Google Phone
great reader, bought it for my wife at a great price.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
you cant get a better device for reading ebooks than this. the battery lasts weeks and its extremely light	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
nice product. reading made easy. bought it for a friend.	Google Phone
the paperwhite makes reading in all conditions a pleasure.	Lightning Charging Cable
great for beginners i like reading on the beach and i like to read in the shade that it works and it works great	34in Ultrawide Monitor
after having this for a year, it got a bit wet and called kindle and they said they would fix it or replace it cause it was within the one year warranty. they replaced it for free.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the paperwhite feature works great. can read books in a room with low light	USB-C Charging Cable
i purchased this reader for my wife who is constantly reading. my wife currently has a kindle fire hd 7"" which she loves, but it is not the best for reading poolside where there is a lot of sunlight. i wanted to get her something that was easier to read in direct sunlight so she could enjoy her relaxing time even more.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it's a great product, but giving the price, you can find the same thing in the form of a cheap tablet that does more. still a solid product tho	Flatscreen TV
i had it for two months and i start loving to read.	27in FHD Monitor
i own the original kindle reader. it had several quirks that have been fixed. pages turn easier, almost all functions are faster, and lighted pages are much easier to read in low light. the only negative so far is the shorter battery life.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is the best reading tablet to date, crystal clear and bright	USB-C Charging Cable
it will not charge in usb on computer, have to take it in.	USB-C Charging Cable
it's doing a great job . just go for it without doubt.	ThinkPad Laptop
you can use wifi anywhere that it's available. lots of choices	20in Monitor
great reader with incredible battery lifewould def buy again	USB-C Charging Cable
holding the kindle paperwhite is like holding a paperback book. it is formatted to be a book. yes, i have an ipad and mini but the kindle is much lighter and more ""booklike."" it can hold 100s, if not 1000s, of books.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought a second kindle so my wife would stop using mine. outstanding product. easy to download books and the book prices are reasonable.	20in Monitor
i like the size of this kindle device. the battery lasts a very long time and charges quickly. haven't found anything not to like about the kindle paperwhite.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is the perfect option for me. i can have more than one book at my disposal, yet it's lightweight and easy to carry. the print is easy on the eyes, too.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this reader is a gift to my daughter for christmas. she said that it works great at the beach!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
awesome! perfect for all readers. the backlight is great for reading in bed.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great product for the price. makes it easier to read with the contrast in text and background.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is so perfect for reading. if you only want it for reading, then i would most definitely get this. i can read for hours on it, in light and in the dark. it's super easy to buy books and download books. favorite christmas purchase!	USB-C Charging Cable
but, this isn't a bad substitute. the print and light are easily adjustable. it's small and lightweight, easy to carry and holds a charge for a week or so. at the font size i use it takes 2 to 3 kindle page turns to equal 1 page turn of a book and thus i think i would prefer a larger screen. although it's touted as better for the eyes than reading using the kindle app on a tablet, i really don't think that is the case for me. for me a tablet is just as usable although heavier and less convenient. overall , for the price, the pros outweigh the cons and i would recommend it.	Macbook Pro Laptop
adjustable backlights are much nicer than clip on light.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this kindle for our grandchild and he loves it.for anyone who just loves to read this size and weight is perfect!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this kindle reader is light weight and easy on eyes. its a good reader but can be better if its ui is improved and made fast.the builtin lights are good and offer a nice option to read in dark. its fro some one totally in to books and wants to have those in handy.	Wired Headphones
i love kindle ereaders. in fact i had purchased 4 paperwhites over the years. the design is absolutely amazing. it is my most favorite device for long reading. tablets like ipad are no comparison on this. i also believe this is the best gifts for kids.	Wired Headphones
awesome reader. great light control to read in bed at night within waking your partner.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very goodwas undecided between new paperwhite and voyage models and doing a lot of research to see which one is best. based on some personal analysis on instore samples, i felt the voyage has nothing more price worthy than what new pw could offer with lesser . if you are undecided like me, don't worry about the gimmicks of voyage, go for pw.	27in FHD Monitor
works well for my 86 year old mom. she can see print very clearly.	Lightning Charging Cable
the only thing i don't like is i can put my books in order	Lightning Charging Cable
i had an older kindle that i still love but it didn't have the backlight. this one is lighter weight and has the backlight making it perfect to carry with me everywhere i go. so delighted that my husband thought to get this as a christmas present for me to enjoy!	27in FHD Monitor
i had the original kindle and still use it but this new one is a delight. the screen is very bright and touchable. this makes it easier to read and also to turn pages.	Google Phone
bought it as a gift for my daughter as an ipad replacement. reading without distraction is priceless. connectivity with local public library makes kindle more valuable.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is the ereader you want to get if you want to avoid distractions such as any other apps being installed. just get your books, and go find a tree somewhere.	Vareebadd Phone
love to read and this little thing is perfect. i carry it everywhere. i read all the reviews and was on the fence since i used my phone or kindle fire to read but the lighting on the paperwhite is so much better for my eyes and the size is great. love this and highly recommend.	Wired Headphones
love it. you can read without diestraftions of notifications as you would from your phone.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
great ereader, long battery life. was hesitant to make the change from actual books to an ereader but i have no regrets!	Wired Headphones
it is a very nice reading source. i bought it for my wife. she had the original kindle and liked it but the back lighting makes all the difference. nice size and good battery life.	Macbook Pro Laptop
my kids have owned the kindle fire for over 4 years. it was time for them to be more focused on reading and this is one of the best dreaded out there. kids love the device and they can quickly borrow books from the city library.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is what ereaders should be like. page turning is quick, the backlight is amazing. reading in bed at night is perfect with this. i take it with me everywhere.	Lightning Charging Cable
excellent product i love the back light on my kindle	Macbook Pro Laptop
i feel that it is a good product for reading a book, especially since you can carry many books with you instead of ""carrying"" the actual books. i thought it would be a brighter screen than others but am a little disappointed in that regard.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have been very pleased with the whitepaper ereader so far. good battery life and easy to use.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i loved me previous kindle but always had to keep light on to read in the dark. the backlight on this makes it so much easier to read in the dark, it's not too bright and battery goes for about two weeks. the resolution is higher too, font looks crisp and sharp.	Google Phone
my grandaughter loves it! found it easy to understand and can read anywhere she likes.great product!	Lightning Charging Cable
it is a very convenient product for ebook reading. more sophisticated.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
used it for 2 days and the screen froze 5 timesthe kindle just won't switch on. had to restart each time, and sometimes restarting won't help. it is clearly defective. brought it to a bestbuy store to exchange, but custumer service won't replace it. asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none. then they said they could give me store credit, and i would go line up in checkout and order a new one. since i got mine on a discount, i had to pay the price difference! this is ridiculous. they wouldn't order a replacement for a defective product, unless i pay more? got a refund in the end even though i liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange. i guess purchases with discounts are not protected.	Lightning Charging Cable
my grandson loves his kindle reader!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
he loves to read so he will enjoy sitting down with it	Lightning Charging Cable
feels durable and battery lasts a long time! the screen is easy to read.	27in FHD Monitor
really like the kindle paperwhite. easy to handle, easy to read, easy to access my books. recommend.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have enjoyed a kindle reader for years. if you think your phone works just as well, you probably have never tried a kindle reader. when my last one began to fade, i hit the reviews and then bought this one. i would rather pay a bit more and have all the features that i want, than go for the best value for money to save a few bucks and have buyer's regret. in this case they are both the same.	Google Phone
love this item, kindle with the light is so totally worth it	27in FHD Monitor
this kindle was very good and i enjoyed it a lot, i love it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

had previously been using third gen kindle 2011 but this paperwhite is a great upgrade. love the backlight and new font.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
perfect gift for my dad, he loves to read. he is in love with kindle.	Apple Airpods Headphones
much easier on the eyes than a regular tablet and long battery life. you'd think it could be priced at the level of an inexpensive tablet seein how it's pretty much dedicated as a reader, but it is what it is and it's a good product for those who enjoy readin.	Google Phone
bought this for my wife for christmas after reading the reviews. hands down the best ereader for the price.	USB-C Charging Cable
it is my third kindle. the reading experience with kindle is always good.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
asked a bestbuy employee if i could connect to my library. he told me yes so i bought the kindle. when i got it home, found out that downloading books from my library was not an option, so i returned kindle.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i brought this one, because that one i had still working but couldn't sign up online.	27in FHD Monitor
very difficult to operate this if having problems knowing how to get to the instructions. should have some computer knowledge prior to purchase.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
makes book downloading and reading easy as ever. so compact and lightweight too.	Wired Headphones
with 5 kindles currently in the home this was a nice edition for my mother for reading her books. i compared this directly next to the basic kindle and the clarity of the font made it well worth the price difference.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i was hesitant to buy a kindle paperwhite as i already owned an entry level kobo that was about 6 years old. however, i'm goad that i upgraded as this device is smaller, lighter, and more ergonomic. its a lot easier to hold for an extended period of time. additionally, as part of the kindle ecosystem, borrowing ebooks from the library is a snap and no longer requires me to hook up to my computer.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this as a christmas gift for my sister, and she can't put it down. battery life is great, and she has found so many great books to read at great prices, and even some free titles she is excited to start reading. it is smaller than i expected, but that makes it easier to take on trips.	iPhone
so far so good. i have not ordered a book yet. i am reading a free one to get the hang of it.	Vareebadd Phone
as usual, amazon does a great job of making the kindle this was for my wife and replaced her previous kindle. awesome product.	20in Monitor
i love the paper white because ican read it if i am out in the sun especially at the beach.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i enjoy the convenience of the size and the ease of reading with this reader.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i had to replace my kindle 3g keyboard after several years because it would no longer charge. so i got this one and i'm satisfied, but i really miss my 3g. the only feature that's better in the newer kindle is the light. turning pages is my main complaint with the touch screen. it sometimes doesn't register the touch and you have to do it again. also going back a page is a pain. supposedly the left 25 of the screen is for going back, but it seems like the left 10 at best and just to be safe i press on the very edge. i miss the buttons for turning pages.i also miss the 3g even though i didn't use it all that often. now i just need to make sure i plan ahead on road trips.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought one for my wife and my daughter who is in college. they both love them. easy to use, great screen and endless choices of material to read.	Macbook Pro Laptop
this was my first kindle purchase and i'm glad i waited. the battery life is awesome rarely do i have to charge it. it's also really easy to purchase more books. also the white pages are easy on the eyes whether it's night or daytime.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the pages look like actual pages from a book to allow for easier reading. bought this for my mother in her 60's and she loves it!	iPhone
so i love, love, love eink. i'm not even a big reader but t's this magic technology that no one seems excited about. there is literally ink inside the screen that moves up or down electronically. so it is literally an actual printed book page that can change in an instance.i like the kindle paperwhite and it does everything i need. but this particular version doesn't have the same pleasing page color as my 5 year old kindle, which is strange. but i really needed the light to actually be able to read when i usually want to read. so when the light is on it's pretty nice.the interface is rather slow, which is to be expected given it's not a traditional lcd screen it's literally a printing press, but i wish the interface had better ways to organize and change the order of books. the other problem i had was that the first one i received had a large hole in the upper layer of the screen where the light diffuses through so it had this glowing hole that reminded me of a giant stuck pixel. also there were a few random stuck black spots. the next one did not have these problems. amazon will replace it for you if it does.	Lightning Charging Cable
my wife is an avid reader and ju st had surgery. on her neck. she is healing well but finds it hard to hold the weight of a book. i bought the kindle for her ad she loves it because she reads in bed and can easily handle it because it is so light. she loves that she can get books in french and any other language she wants.

the screen resolution is so much better than the original kindle. love the backlight.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this as a gift for my grandmother. i debated between the basic kindle or the paperwhite and chose the kindle paperwhite. she loves it! it's very basic and easy for her to navigate. everything is straight forward. the kindle paperwhite is nice because of it being backlite she can read in the dark or ever outside in the direct sunlight. there is no glare whatsoever. the size perfect for her hands and do not get sore or achy as if she was reading a paperback book. if your looking for a device strictly for reading purposes only get the kindle paperwhite. overall, i and my grandmother are greatly impressed with this product. i had my doubts at first due to never using a product like this, but im considering getting myself one.	Wired Headphones
easy to use, backlight feature is really nice. like that you can adjust the font sizes and type.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle paperwhite. so easy to read anywhere. wish the battery lasted longer than it does.	USB-C Charging Cable
this kindle paperwhite is great. it stores plenty of books and has a screen that is easy to read. it is even easy to read outside in the sunlight. i also like how compact, light and easy it is to travel with.	Wired Headphones
i want to rate it 3.5 but best buy lets me rate it 3 or 4, nothing in between. similarly i see no point in upgrading from an old paperwhite until you really want a 300 ppi display. kindle paperwhite is good but not much has changed over the years, if you plan to upgrade over the old one think if it is worth spending.a paperwhite with 3g goes up towards 180200 usd, i would rather invest the money on a tab. if you are sticking with the base version as i brought 99 usd no ads, then its a good deal.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
delivery great handling and use for those wanting a natural reading device instead of the glitter of some technologies	Google Phone
daughter, 8 yrs old, was starting to go thru books quickly and graduating to 2300 page books. with my amazon prime membership, you also get a large selection of books available for free download. saving big bucks. device is light weight and has a long battery life. if you have an amazon prime membership and a reader in the house, this devise is a nobrainer and will pay for itself.

i have been on the fence for quite some time about getting a dedicated ereader. like many, i didn't want to spend money and yet another device. however, review after review always mentions that where the value in the kindle is in the distractionfree reading experience and having finally purchased one, i wholeheartedly agree with this as well. the kindle paperwhite is light weight and is easy to carry around. this is my first kindle since the 2nd gen, and i'm impressed by the speed and screen quality. the lighting on the paperwhite is a huge benefit and is not at all distracting while reading.	Wired Headphones
i knew what i was buying and it was everything as described, love my kindle best part it fits perfect in the palm of my hand, very convenient to use	Apple Airpods Headphones

love that i can read this at night, with the lights off, or have it tucked snugly in my jacket pocket on the go. wonderful device with great battery life.	USB-C Charging Cable
this e reader is easy on the eyes, light weight, has an adjustable back light, and has a decent storage size. it only does black and white so be aware of that if you have books with pictures or images.	Google Phone
this e reader is very lightweight, holds a charge for days and is easy to use. be aware that the display is only black and white so books with pictures are not the best on here. besides that it is great at reducing eye strain and the backlit screen makes for added versatility.	USB-C Charging Cable
i love reading so this ereader works really well for me. i just wish it was a little bigger. i was used to another ereader that had a larger screen. otherwise, it works!	Wired Headphones

ordering this online to pick up at the store was easy until i got to the store where, as usual, there were workers standing around yet i had to wait several minutes for someone to address me at the pickup desk then i had to wait to pay for it at the registers. i would have thought i could purchase it at the pickup center. honestly, if it weren't for the increased risk of stolen delivery items during the christmas season, i probably would have gone with amazon to purchase the kindle. the price was the same through both retailers.

i bought this for my friend and he loved it. he was looking forward to this a couple of years ago.	Lightning Charging Cable
very rice product and my wife loves it. it is a great git for book lovers.	USB-C Charging Cable

Apple Airpods Headphones
i did my research, and this was the tablet i wanted. it was a smooth transaction. the only thing was that i couldn't purchase it ""without special offers"" from anywhere other than amazon direct. i opted to purchase it from best buy ""with special offers"" because of the price. i was pleasantly surprised to find out that i could choose to have the ""special offers"" removed after purchase. i had to pay additionally for this option, but it could be done. none of the reviews i read mentioned that this was possible. i suppose this could change this at any time, but at the time i am writing this, it is an option.i saved delivery time by purchasing at best buy and paid minimally later to have the special offers removed.	iPhone
this is my second kindle. the improvements over the older generation kindles is huge. this kindle is thin and light, i put it in my pocketbook and take it all over. the backlight is handy when needed. the screen clarity is excellent. great device.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

kindle paper white is a fantastic ereader. it has great contrast, is easy on the eyes, and the backlight is just right for reading in darker environments.	Google Phone
my first kindle paperwhite lasted several years, and i used it a lot! when it quit, i immediately went to best buy and purchased another one. after only about five weeks, my new kindle stopped working. i could no longer turn the page again, just like my old one. i went back to best buy and they exchanged it for a new one. if it had been just about another week, they would not have exchanged it. i thought the kindle was a great product, but was disappointed that it had quit again. this time, i bought the insurance plan. best buy treated me great. there was never an issue whether they would replace it or give me a refund. even though i did not have my original receipt, only had my charge card bill, there was not a problem.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
everyone in the family now owned one.works well and easy to read in the sun	Wired Headphones

i used a kindle many years ago but didn't like the size or the weight or the lack of backlight. this solves all those problems. i find the screen is a little small for my vision. when i increase the font size t i need to turn the kindle page more times than a book page. but that's me. otherwise, it does well, turns the page smoothly and is easy to use.	Apple Airpods Headphones
perfect for night time reading and outdoor reading!	Apple Airpods Headphones
bought this for my son to encourage his reading ,and very pleased with this device. i have sideloaded the ability to rent library books and it works well. he can read easily without tiring his eyes or needing to go to library frequently. since i have to drive him everywhere it helped both of us. i wish there were more apps available and native library rental specifically.	Lightning Charging Cable
i have had a kindle since the very first generation, and they have come along way since then. this version is pretty handy, reads well, and navigates okay for kindle . it there was any drawback i would say that the store shopping experience thru the actual kindle needs improvement . it's still very antiquated, and seems antiquated compared to today's browsing market.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
great battery life and having the back lit screen allows you to read in dim or no light.	27in FHD Monitor

had my original kindle for 8 years with never a problem. when it finally died in december, i felt i could just use my ipad and kindle app. but i missed the smaller and easier to hold kindle more than i expected. love the new paper white. no external light source required to read in bed, but easy on the eyes. only regret i can't get my word games on it due to incompatibility, otherwise would be 5 stars.

i was confused between amazon fire and kindle when buying this as both were in the same price range. but i would say that i made the right choice by picking the specialized kindle reader. this is the closest experience to actual bookreading and sometimes even more convenient. would definitely recommend.	USB-C Charging Cable
got for my wife for christmas. she loves it! would recommend to others wanting the experience in a smaller device.	LG Washing Machine
this purchase was a nobrainer. the kindle paper white is all you need for an ereader. plus with amazon you have an opportunity for many free ebooks.	Wired Headphones

this new kindle is smaller than the large one i had. it is made for easy reading. definitely very happy with this updated version	iPhone
i do not like the fact that every thing is in pictures instead of words. on my old paper white i had a list of unread books, now i have pictures. i don't read pictures. if there is a way to make it into a list, i have yet to find it. i thought the that reading is the point.	Wired Headphones
i do most of my ereading when we travel. i always used my i pad, but finally replaced that with the kindle for reading. nice to be able to read in the sunlight, which is not possible with the ipad. the light is also not as harsh as the ipad when reading at night. so now i travel with both.

i have had my kindle paperwhite for over a month now and i absolutely love it. the screen adjustment to match the room lighting is great and it is much faster and responsive than the older kindle my wife has. it is so lightweight and comfortable to hold. one of the best parts is the battery last for weeks even with heavy use.	iPhone
this has the same pixel density as the 200 kindle voyage, the biggest differences being no pressure sensitive buttons and there isn't a glass screen flush with the bezel. the paperwhite is the best value of the kindle lineup.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this for my 80 year old mother. she loves to read books but has difficulty getting to the store. this was a perfect gift for her though it did take some time explaining how to use it. it isn't the easiest device to use but now that she knows how to download books, she loves it!

light and easy to read, battery lasts a good while. the builtin light makes it a pleasure to use at night in bed.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the paperwhite is certainly better than the regular kindle, primarily due to the back lighting feature. if you buy a kindle ereader, this would be the one to buy. you could spend more for the higher end models but there's really no need. the main issue with this ereader is the smudge effect at the bottom of the screen. i tried two paperwhites and both had the same issue. perhaps this is just how they are.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my friend loves it. it's what he needs for his holiday.	27in FHD Monitor
i purchased this for my husband who has been so busy that reading for pleasure just wasn't happening as much as he liked. if he'd take his tablets to read for pleasure he would get distracted doing work rather than reading for pleasure. he now makes the time to have some time off and is enjoying novels again. good pricing. now we are considering getting kindles for each of our grandchildren too.	27in FHD Monitor
my husband and i live in the dominican rebublic as missionaries teaching the deaf about the bible and our god. on mondays we take the day off and head to the beach to chill and read a book. our various tablets iphones, ipads, samsung galaxy, and nooks we use for teaching the deaf just didn't cut it in the bright sunshine to relax reading a novel. so while visiting the states we invested in our down time and purchased kindle paperwhites for each other. it is a basic tablet. we didn't want it to do ""everything"". that's what our other tablets can do. we wanted them to be able to get back to our love of reading for pleasure. the paperwhites are right on target for reading on the beach.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought paperwhite as a gift for my wife for christmas. she cant put it down!, if she wakes up in the middle of the night the paperwhite is on and it the light doesn't bother me.	AA Batteries (4-pack)

we weren't crazy about the idea of getting another portable electronic device that distracted her from her schoolwork. 5th graders need to read much more than previous years and the paperwhite not only encourages reading but eliminates the clutter that occurs from many paperbacks. the screen is the perfect size, lighting more than adequate, and the functionality is ideal.

had the kindle 7th gen with no backlight and upgraded to the paperwhite. was one of the best decisions i've made. you don't even notice that there is a backlight because it blends in so well, and compared to the 7th gen is a nightandday difference. buy this, you will not regret it.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
perfect size and easy on the eyes. none of that bright light that tables have to blind you in the evening.	Google Phone
the only time i really have to read is late at night when i don't want to turn on the lights and wake everyone up. the back light and touch screen make this version of the kindle much better than the previous ones.	Wired Headphones
this thing is ok. next time we get electronics it will be amason	ThinkPad Laptop
wanted a easy reading for outdoors. close this based on reviews. did not need to replace my ipad with the more expensive fire tablet. would have given it a 5 star but amazon packages them with out a charger adapter.	Google Phone
works great. is a good upgrade for those who have a regular kindle. terrific for low light reading.	Wired Headphones

great reading device under all lighting conditions	Lightning Charging Cable
after about 2 months of use, i can say that my wife and i are very happy with our purchase. the amazon paperwhite kindle is exactly what we wanted for . reading literature. we tried to many times to duplicate the effect with a tablet but found the shiny glare to be too much. the paperwhite is easy on the eyes, and easy to use. i did give it 4 stars instead of 5, because after purchasing i learned there is slightly more expensive version like 20 more that doesn't include the frequent ads were where having to deal with. luckily we were able to find out how to pay amazon an extra 20 to eliminate the ads, but it would have been nice to not have to deal with it at all. i would recommend anyone looking at this product get the version for 20 more and eliminate the annoyance of the ads.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

old one broke after 9 years, new paper white is great, can read in low light, etc.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i have had several kindles they don't last super long before breaking and love reading on them. my only complaint is that they aren't very durable and tend to break after about 2 years of regular use. being that they aren't super expensive, it's not a huge deal, but bit enough to not earn 5 stars.

i had the old kindle with no back light . this new one was a great price . i still use both but this is great on a plane or in bed at night when i can just turn it off and i don't have to get up and turn my light off	USB-C Charging Cable

very easy to use and download any size book you would like	USB-C Charging Cable
i have been a kindle owner for years, the original kindle had be great but i hated the absence of a backlight. and the kindle fire was similar to reading on my phone with hurting my eyes. so when the paperwhite was released i was intrigued. i finally received this as a christmas gift and it's perfect. the battery can lasts weeks on a charge. there's no glare. my eyes never hurt. this is perfect for anyone who just wants to read ebooks. there is no headphone or speaker so audio books will not be able to be used. when typing the letters are a bit leggy but you get used to it. i did have a problem registering my amazon account but was able to contact amazon via chat and they fixed it within 5 min. definitely worth the money, i can now have books with me at all times.

i have been a big fan of amazon kindles for the last five years. each time a new one comes out i hesitated to buy, simply because my old one was working perfectly. christmas i was looking for that gift that my wife would like. she too is a big kindle fan. i grabbed a paperwhite for her for christmas. for the next five days, i kept hearing how great it was compared to the old one. so off to best buy to buy the second. these are top notice upgrade. i don't think i have grabbed my kindle and gotten the weak or dead battery logo. it has an amazing battery life. on top of that, the backlight works fantastic in low light environments. i can sit on a plane and read with no issues.

bought for my wife as christmas present. she has early version of kindle. she likes how little it weighs, and doesn't need a cover with separate light. she also likes swiping to turn pages rather than pushing a button. it is easy to read and has adjustable fonts.only negative is after downloading a book, she has to search for it, rather than it automatically appearing on list of books.

this was an upgrade from old kindle. screen is great and love the size of the screen.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was an upgrade from my original kindle. i love the backlight screen! even though the device is smaller than the original kindle, i'm somehow able to read the font without my glasses. the battery life on this model is much longer too.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

good for reading on the fly and great battery life	USB-C Charging Cable
bought for our child who has vision issues but loves to read. she can borrow library books and they return ""automatically"". appreciate that the screen lighting is more gentle than other tablet items. grateful for no game options. wish i could control the ads better! that's my only complaint. some advertised books are plain wrong for a young one but there it is with a sample or picture. just gotta keep an eye on that.

bottom led lighting is a bit uneven, and a bit distracting, but the overall package is otherwise excellent for reading, and without all the tempting distractions on a conventional tablet, so one can really focus on reading. the 300ppi is really crucial for images and especially maps and diagrams.

i picked up a regular kindle touch a few months ago thinking i'd be fine with it. lately my schedule is only allowing me to read in the evenings when its already darker out, and i don't like having to keep all the lights on to read. decided to pull the trigger on one of these paperwhites, and yep, wish i'd gone this route to begin with. the increased pixel count plus the built in light makes this thing a joy over the regular kindle. makes it a lot easier on my eyes and for that alone i recommend it!	Apple Airpods Headphones
this case works great. it was exactly what i was looking for.	27in FHD Monitor
i would have gave it a five star rating but it will change pages to easily. you will either go forward or backwards by just toughing the screen.	Apple Airpods Headphones
purchased for 8yo. appears and feels wellbuilt. plastic screen vs. glass on higherend kindle models should prove more child resistant. screen is recessed below frame edges, which also helps mitigate catastrophic damage in the event of a fall. battery life is very good. several books read at moderate brightness and still over 50 battery available. the screen has very good contrast ratio. in daylight, the backlight is completely unnecessary. the backlight is bright, and still soft enough to not induce extra eye strain. highly recommended for any bookworm, young or just young at heart!	27in FHD Monitor
this was a gift for my wife, she had a previous version, and she loved the upgrade to tjis new version.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

i originally purchased the paper white and after a week of that, i decided to upgrade to the voyage for a couple reasons. 1 perhaps my phone has made me lazy but i've grown accustomed to autobrightness. it's something that i don't even really think of at all. until you have to manually adjust it. the voyage is currently the only kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. i've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. i humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' autobrightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. for instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. i have had no problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the kindle. it's brilliant.2 page turn haptic buttons. these are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, i simply squeeze. i do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as i find i've needed to adjust my grip lower than i normally would have held on to the device. it's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3 the flush screen. this makes a big difference to me i was not a fan of the recessed screen on the paper white and even the nook has a flush screen! amazon really needs to introduce waterproof kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. this is also my only negative about the device the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the paper white and i've heard wether it's true or not that is because the voyage has a glass screen, while the paper white has plastic? i'm not sure, but the only time i notice this is when i'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. i may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4 the general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the paper white. this also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the paper white, which is always a good thing.to recap this is the only kindle to feature the autobrightness feature not even the oasis has itprobably to save on weight and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the paper white.	ThinkPad Laptop
great product! i love kindle ereaders! is light, fast and excellent.	iPhone
love this kindle the press side page turner is great.	USB-C Charging Cable
i have both the kindle voyage and the low end kindle fire.while the 50.00 fire is an amazing deal, for serious readin,g the kindle voyage is far easier on the eyes and has superior resolution. now, it lacks many of the features of the less expensive fire, such as color and online with wifi as a reader it is well organized and a pleasure.truthfully, it isn't a whole lot better than the paperwhite. it has a feature or two, but i'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. it is still an excellent device.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great alternative to using tablet for reading. only problem is trying to read a .pdf file it only enlarges the page and does not resize the document to easily move forward.	LG Dryer
purchased after theft in seattle. it was on sale and works great.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is so far the best kindle i have ever owned. i love the screen and the resolution on it. the device out performs all of the other e readers on the market.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the resolution on this screen is amazing and is so close to an actual printed page.	27in FHD Monitor
wow! it is so nice to have a light and easy to hold device that only carries tons of books! no distractions like on my ipad, with email messages pinging in and facebook updates to check.just books and lots of them!the kindle voyage is everything they said it would be.light, back lit with self adjusting levels, page turners, all the bells and whistles. i am so glad i waited and splurged for this one!	Lightning Charging Cable
the voyage is my first ereader and i am not disappointed. it is light, clear and a joy to use	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the kindle voyage is the best ereader experience available. text is supersharp, it's comfortable to hold, the builtin selfadjusting light is awesome, and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel. unfortunately, all those great features come at a 199 price that is 80 more than amazon's kindle paperwhite and more than double the cost of the company's entry level reader, both of which are excellent in their own right. so five stars for the device itself and minus one star for the high price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this for my kids and very happy with that.	Google Phone
new kindle voyage is a nice upgrade from the basic model. smaller e reader with a brighter light. so far so good.	USB-C Charging Cable
i have a paper white 1 and 2. honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. i certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. to note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.	USB-C Charging Cable
i am extremely happy with my new kindle voyage. the text is so sharp and crisp, the images look much better than on the kindle paperwhite. the device is extremely light and comfortable to hold, the adaptive front light works great. i have an ipad with the kindle app, but the reading experience is so much better on my kindle voyage that don't regret the purchase one bit.	Flatscreen TV
nice ereader for reading books. browser should be improved otherwise fine for reading books, another irritating part is ads pop up which amazon shud fix	USB-C Charging Cable
i have a previous version of the kindle, but this one surpasses it in every way, from the resolution to the automatic brightness display. recommend it highly.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the voyage is a great reader for those like myself who love to read books. the lines and images are crisp and clean. its light weight even with the cover. the only thing is the origami cover was something that i would have thought of designing differently. it feels uncomfortable to hold. the device though is awesome and the page turn features are great you can use either side to turn pages. would suggest to anyone who loves to read!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
first of all i'm amazed i could buy it from best buy, while amazon says it will be in stock on december 1st in more than a month from now. best buy is indeed the best!the voyage itself is simply fantastic. the size is right, it's very lightweigh, quite zippy, text is super crisp, and i love the autobrightness feature.	Lightning Charging Cable
the new kindle voyage is quite a step forward for the kindle dedicated reader line. it is a beautiful device almost like something from apple. i like the lighted screen and the page forward and back ""buttons"" on the sides of the device. but it is rather pricey not yet convinced it is worth the upcharge.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
best e reader yet ! the new voyage is much better then the first paperwhite which was great !	Wired Headphones
light weight, great upgrades from the paperwhite. love it!	27in FHD Monitor
i am a gadget guy and a big fan of tablets and eink readers. they each have their specialties and purposes, and ereaders are still best for reading. i have bitten a kindle supporter from the beginning, this latest model only further improves on that reputation.the back lighting is awesome and the touch screen is amazing. the clarity and definition is outstanding. i was do excited waiting for this to be released and was very pleased with the results!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i am an avid reader, and have purchased both the first and second generations of the kindle paperwhite products. upon reading about the voyage, i knew i had to have one. although it's a bit pricey for an ereader, it's definitely worth it for me. as much as i read, i believe the new screen will result in less eye strain. it's a beauty to look at. especially when held next to the paperwhite 2nd gen and compared.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is definitely the rolls royce of the ereaders love all the new features that it has. upgraded from the paperwhite to the voyage.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
upgraded from a kindle paperwhite. i love the brighter screen and increased resolution. i am a book addict and the savings over printed material allows me to buy more books. the availability of reference texts is increasing which is a big plus.	Wired Headphones
i have the second generation kindle paperwhite and the new voyage is far superior to it. the resolution is much sharper, the back light is much brighter and the power button location is much more convenient. i highly recommend it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i never owned kindle before. i tried to just be content with a pw 2, but after close comparison in store, i sticked to the voyage. luckily, i haven't been disappointed so far.	USB-C Charging Cable
this was actually for my daughter and she has rarely put it down since she got it.	Flatscreen TV
i can hold this next to my kindle paperwhite and see that is brighter, more evenly lit, sharper and faster. but 200 is pushing the price a little high. if a friend wasn't looking to buy my old one, not sure i would have paid that much.	Lightning Charging Cable
moving to this from the first generation paperwhite appears to have been the right move. i love the new size, it just feels tiny and perfect in the hand. the new automatic brightness setting works quite well. i do wish i could crank up the force required to activate the page turn buttons however, as i have frequently hit them accidentally. the page turn buttons do work with gloves on which a great for reading in a tree stand.	ThinkPad Laptop
got this as an upgrade to my kindle touch. page turns are crisp the pressuresensitive page buttons on the sides are a nice addition. i especially like the selfadjusting brightness. very happy with the purchase. battery life is great so far, even with the backlight on.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my first kindle but i'm loving it. i picked it up a few days after it was released. one of the things i love the most is i'm a reader but i am not a car owner so i get almost everywhere by bike. i got tired of lugging around heavy hardcover books from the library now my voyage weighs less than most paperback books. an extra bonus for me is, it fits in a pocket i wasn't using in my pannier i carry stuff to work everyday. i love the clarity of the text and pressure point page turning versus screen swipes. i also love that i charged it when i got 4 days ago and it is still more than have battery power.	Google Phone
the newest kindle ereader voyage is a very good upgrade over the current model. it has several new hardware coming software enhancements over the current model. however, unless you do an extreme amount of reading, i would not recommend upgrading if you owned the current paperwhite generation. the high price does not justify it.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
the better resolution and slightly smaller size makes a worthwhile investment if you read for hours. the commercials that tell you how much better it is to read on a kindle voyage vs a tablet are true. i read for hours at a time on weekly plane trips. if i use a tablet my eyes hurt after just a couple of hours. on a kindle because of the side lighting i can read for 5 hours and my eyes never hurt .	USB-C Charging Cable
upgrading from an older kindle. wow. lighter. crisper text is an understatement. throw in the lighting and the new interface for page advancement. pricey but if you want the best, you won't be disappointed.	20in Monitor
product was as described and delivered on time as scheduled.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i never owned a kindle before. this was easy to setup and get going.it also looks really good. the text is super easy to read even at smaller fonts. i also really like the buttons on the side that turn the pages because it is a lot easier to flip pages compared to tapping the screen.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i have owned exactlo, nooks, kobo's and kindles. this is the cadillac of readers!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
was a christmas gift and i ended up returning it because it wasn't exactly what i was looking for.	Wired Headphones
the screen is very sharp and easy to use. the letters are crisp and distinctive. the back light works well in the dark or light. i have no problem reading at night in the dark or during the day outside in direct sunlight. the new page press buttons are perfectly placed and very convenient. it's light weight and small enough to hold in one hand whole reading. i only have to charge it every 2 weeks.i would recommend this edition to anyone who enjoys reading.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle voyage. it truly is almost like reading a paper book.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
upgraded from a paperwhite and the build quality of this unit is much, much better! just it's kind of expensive for an ereader.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
purchased for my wife to replace her previous kindle. she loves it. great product.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the voyage is easily the best kindle avaiailable. the page turn buttons are a little wonky a times, but i find the highres screen worth it.	27in FHD Monitor
everything about it is outstanding except the price!	Wired Headphones
purchased for my mother for christmas. she hasn't put it down since.	USB-C Charging Cable
overall i've been very happy with my new kindle voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite v1 and the backlight is much more even. i've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. it makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. the only issue i have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly twotone hue. it is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. it isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader.	USB-C Charging Cable
excellent ereader if that is all you are looking for. probably a bit over priced for the casual reader, the voyage is wonderful for those looking for the best reading experience and are willing to pay the price tag and trade the lack of functionality.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i just upgraded from a touch to a voyage and could not be happier. in my opinion this is by far the best kindle yet. its operation and features are similar to the touch and paperwhite but it is lighter and faster and very comfortable in the hand. like other eink devices unlike fire the screen has a matte finish which is really superb for reading. some early reviews i've read complained about part of the screen having a yellowish hue. i have not seen any sign of this so that may have been an early manufacturing issue that hopefully has been corrected. the builtin screen light is amazing.like other eink devices the voyage allows better control and integration of dictionaries, which is really important for specialized reading or reading in a foreign language where one may want to consult several dictionaries insitu to fully understand a word or phrase.there is very little not to like about the voyage. i can only think of two issues to consider1. price no doubt about it, voyage is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth it. when trading off price and performance, i urge you to go into your nearest best buy for a handson look at the various kindles, particularly the paperwhite and voyage to see what you really needwant or can live with.2. a minor point for the evolution of eink readers it would be nice if there was some control of the screen background color or at least an implementation of a warmer background. recent studies suggest adverse effects, particularly regarding getting good sleep, from using electronic devices with brightwhite or bluish screens disrupts melatonin production in the body. this is one of the few in my opinion advantages of kindle fire and kindle for android, where several text background colors are available.i highly recommend voyage the new king of ereaders.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
the auto light adjust has worked great for me and i love the different options for page turning. also, the smaller size and lighter weight is noticeable. if you are buying your first kindle, i would recommend this. if you already have the paperwhite, it's up to you but i've been happy i upgraded.	iPhone
the back light is a great addition to this kindle, along with the page press! it's perfect for only using one hand to read. i would highly recommend this kindle and is worth the extra money.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the automatic light adjustment is pretty cool, but i find myself accidentally covering the sensor which really throws it off.i like being able to press the buttons on either side instead of touching the screen. i also appreciate the flat surface, it doesn't seem to attract as much dust in the corners like my other kindles.	USB-C Charging Cable
i had an original kindle that finally gave up the ghost after several years of service. i have been using my ipad mini as a reader, but it bothered my eyes after extended use. i like a dedicated reader like the voyager. it is about as close as you can come to an actual book. love the adjustable backlot screen.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my last kindle died right before christmas. i was lost with no way to read my books. went to best buy to look at all the different ones available. found that the voyage was the best for my situation. being backlit was perfect for the many different places i read, car, work, restaurants, and planes.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
bought this for my wife for christmas. we have been using a nook for the last 2 years bought at best buy got 2 and a great deal can't use nook to read in sunlight. the voyage is smaller, lighter and easier to use. have not used it yet to read in sunlight. wish it had some other features like color display and sound. waiting to see if i decide to get one until then i still am using a nook. very easy to download a book from public library. it is a tad expensive for what it does.	USB-C Charging Cable
to begin with this is the best reader available right now. brighter than the pw2. just awesome. whether or not its a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic. either way, it's a great piece of hardware light, good grip, light etc. there is one huge issue however! the background light is not uniform it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. for a 200 device thats unacceptable! how much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. the problem was present on all 3 devices i purchased and returned, to the exact same degree. i kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. going through amazon reviews, various online forums it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue youtube it if u cant visualize what i'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it . how bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you what youre willing to settle for. in my case, i hated it but there was no alternative the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. if thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. the pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the best feature of this kindle is the page forwardback buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hards off the unit.	Wired Headphones
great looking display. text is sharp and easy to read. the lighting of screen is wonderful for reading in lower light environments. this is a little more compact than the paper white model. i really love the page press button areas. makes it so you can turn pages without adjusting your hand as long as you are holding the voyage with your thumb resting in the button area. sounds like a minor thing, but to me it's a big convenience!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
already toldpeople about fast pickup.the kindle is great as always.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
lighter than a helium balloon. so thin. bright white screen. crisp letters. intuitive. easy touchscreen page turning or a gentle squeeze on either side of the book and easy menu access. ideal size. i don't know how they can improve this further. just ordered their kindle's origami cover too.

i waited for weeks to get this new model and am happy i did. i love the new features on the kindle voyage. didn't give it 5 stars due to some difficulty with the pressure sensitive buttons. i don't know if it is a flaw with the design or operator error, but sometimes it is more challenging than i think it should be to get the page to turn. it is far easier to swipe the screen so this is what i typically do. but, regardless. . . i love the voyage! it was definitely worth the wait!	USB-C Charging Cable
i really missed my first kindle when my husband gave me a fire 2 years ago. i love to read outside and could not do that with a fire. the voyage is perfect, easy to read anywhere, much longer battery life than a fire. very happy with it and the buttons are easy to use or you can just tap the screen to turn the page.	Lightning Charging Cable
received earlier than expected and was very happy. will continue to buy at best buy in the future	Apple Airpods Headphones
light weight, easy to use, love the lighted background. i am unable to make it stay on page count it keeps going back to hours left to read. but other then that a great ereader.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the reader is great, with a crisp display and excellent battery life. i like having the option of either using the buttons to flip pages, or just swipe it. the latter always required two hands, so the buttons can make it easier.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i previously own a kindle paperwhite version one then upgraded to kindle voyage.big difference. worth the price!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
text is clear. nice not to have the battery die every few days like a conventional tablet.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
my wife and i both enjoyed our kindle voyage so much that we had to buy a second one. this is our first ereader, and it could not be more userfriendly. it works well in all kinds of environments and lighting conditions. a definite winner!	Apple Airpods Headphones
i like everything about the voyage reader. it has a crisp display, is small and lightweight. i give it four stars instead of five because the screen light takes sometimes a while to adjust. the battery life is amazing. prize could be a little less.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this kindle has been great, i upgraded from an original kindle and haven't looked back.i think if you have one of the paperwhite's with the backlight you might not see enough bang for your buck to upgrade though.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is my second kindle purchased. first one was 15 years ago and now the kindle voyage 2. i love my kindle. you can read anywhere even outside in the sun. i read more than ever	Flatscreen TV
the best kindle that i ever had!it is great if you love reading and really want to have the feel of handling a book.great for indoor and outdoor reading	Wired Headphones
i have used both paperwhite and voyage, and voyage has improved its support on the files, allowing you to customize the format especially when you are reading in a foreign language.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
having owned each of the previous kindle readers, this one is without a doubt the best of the bunch. i highly recommend that the serious reader consider this device. do note that this is a reader, not a tablet. grab an ipad or kindle fire for your tablet needs but get this to read books. the high dotperinch count makes it easy on the eyes, as does the evenlydistributed light. superb device!	Google Phone
while generally a minor upgrade from the paperwhite, it's just the best ereader on the market. xray seemed unnecessary until i was reading game of thrones and forgot who certain people were. the choice to swipe or pinch to change pages is nice too. it's a great device though if you're on a budget you would do fine with the last version.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
couldn't be happier with this latest kindle ereader! love being able to turn pages by pushing a button and the bright uniform lighting! it's a big step up from my first generation paperweight!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
was a late christmas gift to myself. updated from the paperwhite 2 and the difference is very noticeable.	LG Dryer
if you already have a paperwhite then there is no need to upgrade. but if you are in the market this has an excellent display and quick page turns. the reason to buy a dedicated ereader is the 3 week long battery life. love it	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
excellent device. screen is impressive. happy with this purchase, and looking forward to reading many books on it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is the very best devise to read from. the print is one hundred percent book like. the device is light, elegant and a pleasure to use. there is nothing that comes close.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this kindle is a great product. i really enjoy it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my new kindle! i have owned them all and each one improves on the last. it's a great way to read! i have the origami book cover as well and did not expect to like it but actually, i love it!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i had a first gen paperwhite and wasn't sure if the upgrade would be worth it but it really is a nice step up. software is pretty much the same obviously, but the screen is a real step up and isn't that why you get a kindle over a tablet.	USB-C Charging Cable
i am a big fan of ereaders. i prefer the eink screens over tablet screen when reading books. i decided to pick up the new kindle voyage. here are my thoughts.first, the kindle is much sleeker and lighter than the paperwhite model. it's very easy to hold for a long length of time without getting tired.secondly, the addition of the page turn buttons is a welcomed addition. the buttons make it so easy to hold the kindle with one hand and turn pages.lastly the screen. i marked off a star because i had to return my first voyage directly to amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that was very distracting while reading. the replacement kindle voyage that i received had a perfect screen and the 300 ppi looks amazing. that being said, amazon needs to really focus on quality control because i've read that the yellow tint on the screen is a common issue. if you're spending 200 for an ereader, then the screen should be perfect. especially since this is the 3rd generation of the lighted screens for the ereaders.if you're an avid reader, then the kindle voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make. if you're a casual reader who has a paperwhite, you're probably okay with what you have.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this is my first kindle. i'm not sure how i lived without one now. the screen is excellent. i love being able to read outside no glare! and in bed built in light!. not sure how useful the automatic light adjuster is but it is a neat idea. maybe as i use it more i will come to appreciate the automatic light adjustment.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
user friendly and features a 4gb capacity for ample storage. pagepress provides reimagined page turns, and an adaptive front light promotes visibility in dimly lit areas. so far so good!	20in Monitor
we had previously owned kindle paperwhite version 1 and this is a substantial improvement. the new screen is much brighter and the response is quicker .	USB-C Charging Cable
the flush bezel and display are a huge improvement. the text is crisp and easy on the eyes. the page press function and inclusionposition of the touch sensors is perfect. the price seems a bit high for something as simple as an ereader, but if you love to read this is a must have. you will not be disappointed.	27in FHD Monitor
i know it is entirely a personally bias, but i love kindles and this is one of the best kindles ever.	USB-C Charging Cable
i have never owned a kindle and was using the kindle ap for ipad for the last several years. this little device is remarkable. the page is crisp and clear, the navigation is so easy. purchases are simple and straight forward. i love it!	Lightning Charging Cable
the voyage, when it worked, was great the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the paperwhite. that said, it started to freeze up quickly after i got it. hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon and the price of early adoption, sometimes, because overall, i couldn't be more pleased with the working voyage.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
as usual amazon does it again. fabulous ereader. love the auto adjustment of the on board light!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i really like the voyage, it looks great, and worth the money.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
so many improvements over previous models. love the new page turn feature.	Wired Headphones
i choose store pick up in new york and works great. love my kindle voyage	Lightning Charging Cable
i find myself reading even more now that i have the kindle voyage. it is easy to hold and maneuver, the perfect size, small and sleek. page turning is easy with one hand and the back light makes reading in any setting a pleasure.	27in FHD Monitor
i'm not one for reviewing usually but my oh my do i love this thing. it is lightweight and amazing! i love how crisp it is and how bright it is.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle voyage is always with my in my purse. it is light, compact and easy to hold. i still love hard cover books but now i don't have to carry around the books from my book club. some of the books i would rather not have to keep up with anyway. and, i can jump back and forth between stories.	27in FHD Monitor
this is the best kindle i have ever used. this is way better than the kindle fire hd which i also own.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
always wanted to read more and i am with kindle voyage. this version rocks all previous versions. the side lit screen, smooth resolution, ultra lightweight in hand feel, and more make this the kindle that's perfect to me.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love the voyage. the display is clean and crisp and i have found the auto adjusting lighting to work perfectly for me. i love the side page turning buttons. i no longer have to use two hands to read a book anymore.	Apple Airpods Headphones
this is definitely an improvement over the paperwhite, not sure is worth the premium though. while faster than paperwhite it is still way less responsive than an ipad, it is very hard to type on it when searching or sharing on goodreads for instance.i like the navigation areas on the edge of the screen but i'm not crazy about them. i'm not sure what would be a better alternative but they are not all that comfortable while reading in bed. i guess a thumb swipe would still be better if the device would respond more nicely.i previously had a paperwhite which got lost and i thought i'd better buy the latest kindle now.when i bought the paperwhite it has been an experiment, as i'm not an avid reader and i have a hard time reading paper book since i got surrounded by gadgets. i actually read few books on the paperwhite and i enjoyed it. so when i lost it misplaced it i was longing for it as i had few books i wanted to read.if this would be priced at least 50 cheaper i think it would be a 5 star proposition. like it is now, it is a tad too expensive for the scope and the shortcomings. closer to 100 it would be a sweet price.prefered buying at bestbuy over amazon as the loyalty programs are better vs nonexistent and i also used a movers coupon.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i've started to allow this device to grow on me. yes i saw some color variation but either my eyes have adjusted or it's gone away. i'm back to reading like i used to and love it!	Wired Headphones
it has what i wanted click to turn page and that is the only reason i paid that price for it. there is nothing special about it. i thhought that the battery would last longer and as an avid reader it doesn't last long enough.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i can finally read outside and for more than 20 minutes at a time.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i love this kindle. faster than the paper white in how it responds to changing pages andor books. the self adjusting light levels works very good in mine. having the option on the frame to change pages is great but you have to press a little hard on the forward page button or it will do a backward change instead this is the only reason why i don't give it a 5.i love this reader	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i like it. however, when reading the page number is not shown. also unable to use the dictionary. still in the 'new' stage.	Flatscreen TV
the best ebook reader in the market. the text is crisp and i love the backlighting.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
fantastic ereader. battery lasts a few weeks on a single charge if you leave wifi turned off. feels great in your hands. is very lightweight.	USB-C Charging Cable
works well from outdoors, to plane to reading in bed. no issues. excellent all around. better than a light.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
having had an original kindle which i have enjoyed for several years, i decided to upgrade to the newest kindle voyage. i love the touch screen functionality and the lighted reading. i only wish i had done it sooner.	Lightning Charging Cable
love the small size and the auto light. use this every day.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle is very great reader and recommendable for people.	iPhone
the reader is very compact so it can easliy fit into a bag or pocket. the auto light feature is also a plus.it takes a little bit to get adjusted to the side tabs and presume that future versions of this device will be improved upon.	Wired Headphones
if you are in doubt about spending the extra money to buy the voyage. don't be. if it hadn't been a gift i would have most like not spent the money but after using it i am so glad i have this one.	USB-C Charging Cable
definitely easy on the eyes for long reading sessions, especially when compared to the lcd screens of smart phones and tablets. the only issues we had were that it drops the connection to our wifi network and then won't connect to the kindle store. i don't think it's an issue with my network since all our other devices don't have the connectivity issues we had with this.	iPhone
out of the box there really is nothing to do but plug it in to the usb drive and you're ready to go. you get a pop up reminder asking if you want to use the drive as a back up. if you select yes or no that will be the last time you see it. if you say ""decide later"" it will come up each time you plug it in to the usb drive.	Lightning Charging Cable
this is my third kindle, plus i have used the kindle app on my two ipads and three iphones. i always want to have a real kindle so i will read in peace and avoid distraction from email, texts and such.this is much more readable that all of the previous models. the resolution is as good as i could ever want. the lighting is perfectly even and makes reading in any light or lack of completely comfortable. the screen response is almost perfect, but i am just getting use to the new side areas to turn pages. i love the weight and can read in any position, including on my back in bed, with one hand.i am perfectly fine with paying 200 for this kindle. if you want something to read your books, and nothing else, this is the product for you.	20in Monitor
i like the size and battery life. it would be nice to have instant definitions for foreign language books. i really like the vocabulary review.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
awesome product! backlit, shows you page number easier to turn pages.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
i love the new kindle. so much brighter then my old one.	Google Phone
i bought this for my wife and she loves it. text show very sharp and clear and there are a ton of kindle books to buy and read. very well made.	Wired Headphones
reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly	USB-C Charging Cable
easy to read screen in a small light package. excellent battery life and even fits into my work pockets.	20in Monitor
excellent screen, the small changes to the form make a huge different i adore the flatness so much, and the brightness is a perfect for daylight. imo, worth the cost	ThinkPad Laptop
i enjoy how small this version is, although if you are looking for a lot of features, i would recommend other kindle products. pretty much, this is similar to carrying around a paperback book in size and portability.	Apple Airpods Headphones
when i compare the screen of this voyage to my previous paperwhite, the qualify of the display was much better. light is more even and soft.	Apple Airpods Headphones
what a great ereader. amazon continues its dominance in the ereader field with this entry. light and comfortable to hold. perfect combination of hepatic feedback buttons and adaptive backlighting. seems to stay charged forever even with regular use. i would definitely recommend this and would buy again.	USB-C Charging Cable
i am an avid reader. i use to have to pack multiple books on any vacation or trip for business. this has replaced all that. this is my second kindle and i am very impressed. the back light helps for reading at night or in bright places.	Google Phone
after dropping my kindle with a keyboard not techie enough to know which generation it was i did plenty of research before getting my next kindle.i wanted a dedicated ebook as i don't want distractions when i read. let's make this simplei have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.the automatic light makes it great for night reading.it took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last kindle, this was a feature i really wanted. i like them.i have read only three books on the kindle so far and i still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what i want when i want. i am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapterbook which are features i love.excellent reader. i would purchase again, but i can't say with any honesty that the extra 100 was worth it over the paperwhite, but i have no experience with that model either. i do like this more than my last kindle, so that is all that really matters.	ThinkPad Laptop
great contrast and battery life with easy user interface.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i purchased this for my girl friend and she absolutely loves it. she reads around 34 books a week.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is the reading machine i will recommended for everyone. the sharp font and responsiveness is unparalleled	Apple Airpods Headphones
what could be better than a book? a kindle voyage! this wonderful device is easier to carry around than a book. whenever i need to wait a few minutes, i whip out my kindle. it is clear, it works for a long time without recharging, and it receives new books instantly. i had been using an ipod with audio books for a long time but i got tired of the difficulty in searching for material. it also lost my place unless i was extremely careful. this device is lightweight and slips easily into my handbag or pocket. i also bought the origami case with it, the kindle comes on automatically when it is opened. a great and useful device i love it!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it took awhile to get this kindle as it was out of stock, but it was worth the wait. it is easy to use and the text is very clear. i have had a kindle before but this model is so much better. most enjoyable.	iPhone
the display is even better than the paperwhite, i didn't think they could do that. the page buttons take a minute to get used to but i love them now.	Wired Headphones
no regrets with this device. the paperwhite from amazon is a cheaper model that's worth looking into if this model is too much. i used to read on various iosandroid tablets but wanted to get something that allows me to read ebooks but also have weeks of battery life on a single charge. all those books on such a small and thin device is still amazing to me. this and the official amazon case is what i use.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i eventually had to return it because of the shades of yellow in the backlight when using it at night. it was okay at day time but at night during which i usually read it was not what i expected to be premium cost product. especially it was very annoying to read in the landscape mode. i guess amazon needs a better qa department.	Wired Headphones
had the larger paper white replaced with this model. love it!	Wired Headphones
my daughter enjoys her kindle. lovethis product!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
perfect ereader with great screen and backlight. works great in every condition. definitely recommend the kindle voyage!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
no issues whatsoever. works well! best e reader there is!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
love the back light, fast response to changing pages. the kindle voyage is lite.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is a really great upgrade from the regular kindle, however, it's not such an appealing product after amazon updated the base kindle to the same hiresolution screen. may be worth waiting to see if amazon upgrade the voyage over the coming months.	27in FHD Monitor
this was a gift for my wife who loves to read. she has the kindle fire and enjoys it. her wishes were to have a smaller lighter reader that is also good to ready outside. she found it with the voyage.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought the original paper white and loved it. even though there is not a tremendous difference between the two units, i have found that it is lighter and adjusts to light much better. is it really worth the price difference is questionable. i would recommend this product to any avid reader.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
wife never leaves it at home loves it great display easy on your eyes	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle for reading over my ipad now. best buy gave me a good deal on this kindle, and fast and friendly service. this kindle is easy on my sensitive eyes and a pleasure to hold. i would recommend this to anyone looking for an ereader.	Lightning Charging Cable
bought this for my wife who loves books. she was always agents ebooks but now she can't be without it.	Lightning Charging Cable
i really like not having the bump on the bottom like the previous kindle reader like the previous kindle readeri dislike the fact that the screen is not recessed like the previous kindle reader so that you cannot set the unit down facedown	Lightning Charging Cable
my husband is bed bound and sometimes very weak. the kindle is great for him ,light easy to use and the back light allows him to read in bed without waking me to turn the lights on.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i really enjoy reading on the new kindle voyage. have had other kindle models before this one. i especially like the brightness and lightness of it.only drawback i needed to get use to was turning of pages being a little hesitant.	Lightning Charging Cable
small, light weight and battery lasts. i love this thing. way better than lugging many paperback for long flights.	USB-C Charging Cable
i accidentally cracked my screen on the first day when the voyage was too close to my rocking chair and neither best buy nor amazon would do anything to help. well, amazon offered 15 off purchasing the paperwhite and that wasn't something i wanted at all. now i'm stuck with a 199 broken voyage. not a happy customer. i realize it was my fault but thought they should do something more to minimize the loss and keep my business.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i upgraded my kindle to the kindle voyage because i read in bed and the lamp kept my husband awake. i thought i would be able to use this kindle without the lamp, but for me it is hard to read with the room completely dark even though the back lighting is adjustable. i still use the kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room.i bought the magnetic case so when i open the lid, the kindle wakes up. it is a little smaller than my old kindle and fits in my purse perfectly. all in all i love it and would highly recommend it.	USB-C Charging Cable
this kindle is so good on so many levels. not sure it is worth the price premium over the paperwhite, but you will definitely have the best reader on the market.	Lightning Charging Cable
although the price point is a bit high for what it is i love the new kindle. the screen is beautiful, the back light with autoadjust dimming is great, and it feels very sturdy to hold. i am very glad that i upgraded form the nook but can only give 4 stars due to price.	Product
better than older kindles. reading a book on a kindle is easier than holding a book.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i didn't think it would be that much of an improvement over the paperwhite but taking all of the advances together it definitely beats it. the cost is high but having that crisp of a screen is worth it. obviously when you can buy a kindle fire hd for less you have to be dedicated to the look and functionality of an eink reader for this to be worth it. if you love eink books and want a much better lighting solution than the kindle paperwhite this is the best option.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
even my luddite spouse loves it. easy to use. read in full sunlight.	USB-C Charging Cable
good for leisurereading for fun. not for students.	Lightning Charging Cable
the voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader. it's not a tablet so don't expect features of an internet tablet. however the autoadjust backlight feature minimal flash between pages makes it ideal for readers. this version includes the vocabulary builder, which i find myself using a lot nowadays. however, i'm not sure why it's more expensive than the paperwhite. that's the one i actually wanted but my local store was out of stock. i thought it included the 3g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doesn't. so that's why i'm confused on the price difference. the overall feel of it is fine. not a lot thinner than the original. i keep mine in a case and whenever it goes idle i have to take it out of the case just to press the power button, which is pretty inconvenient. oh and it freezes when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because i thought it was broken but i just held the power button for like ten seconds and it was fine. other than those very minor complaints,i love it. i find myself reading way more than watching tv these days so that's always a plus!	Bose SoundSport Headphones
although the price is high, it is worth and useful.	Macbook Pro Laptop
gave up my tablet for the voyage and haven't looked back. a pleasure to read on.	ThinkPad Laptop
do most of my reading on one of my kindles. reading in sun light to no light is great. easier to take anywhere size wise compared to a paperback. really great for traveling. download several books so i have a variety to read from. long charge life.	Apple Airpods Headphones
pros look no further if you are a book lover and shopping for a ereader. the price is slightly on the higher side but well worth it. you might want to consider the upgraded kindle paperwhite with 300ppi if price is a concern.cons the bookerly font update is not available yet although it is available in the paperwhite.	Lightning Charging Cable
really like the kindle. the screen is very easy on the eyes, much better for reading than my ipad!.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this new kindle is so much easier to read than my second generation kindle that i had for years. it is faster, and the backlight can be adjusted easily to get the right amount of light for your reading pleasure. if you love books, you should get this.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought this game for my son, and he loves it.it is very entertaining.	Wired Headphones
i have owned several kindles over the years, and this one is the best yet. the contrast and clarity is improved over the alreadygood paperwhite 2. i like the page turn ""buttons"" on the bezel as well.	USB-C Charging Cable
this is my first e reader. i did ttry my friends papperwhite but voyage is the best of the e reader world. the screen is awesome. i read a lot at night before i sleep and i use to read in my mobile which after sometime feels like my eyes are burning. but with voyage i can read as much time i want. no strain no burning sensation in my eyes. compared to the papperwhite the screen looks better. feels like i am actually reading a paper book.	Lightning Charging Cable
it's a great ereader and the font is much clearer than that of the paperwhite, but that may not be enough to justify the extra . the page turn buttons are a great addition too.would be good if amazon would add audiobook capability though.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i purchased this specifically to take on a cruise. it exceeded my expectations. the voyager is slim, even with the cover, it is light weight and the screen is very clear. battery life is good. i would absolutely recommend it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

this is my favorite kindle so far. the size is perfect and the weight is minimal. i love the fact it is back lit and i don't need a book light.	Lightning Charging Cable
amazon nailed it. its readability is superior to the book. the new page turning feature is a great improvement over the previous version. and, btw, you can carry a library with you wherever you go.	Lightning Charging Cable

the kindle voyage is the first new model that i finally felt was good enough to replace my kindle4nt nontouch with side buttons. the original 4t and paperwhite models worked poorly for me, and lacked buttons. the pressure sensitive edges of the voyage work great, and the touch screen functions work better in this model.voyage is still at least 50 overpriced, but i ultimately worth the money if moving off an older buttonstyle kindle.	20in Monitor
kindle voyage is great, screen resolution is awesome, love the new page turn buttons i missed these ones from my previous kindle keyboard.	USB-C Charging Cable

works great indoors out. very light weight easy to carry, even in a pocket. amazon downloads are easy quick.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
very disappointed that my kindle voyage, purchased in april, failed after just two uses. went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. since my best buy receipt says i only have 15 days to return it, tried calling amazon support. their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device unacceptable to replace a less than 2month old device with a refurbished one. but, given the poor experience i've had with the voyage, i'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because i purchased from best buy 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!stuck with a 200 paperweight	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i wanted a reader that was easy to use indoor or outside. i am very pleased and so glad i purchased this product. ordering books is also very easy.	Vareebadd Phone
small and light weight, easy to read from in bright light conditions	Flatscreen TV
this is my first kindle. previously i have owned several nooks. the voyage is lightweight and the built in dimming light works great. i would give it the edge over the nook.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is my third kindle and by far the best! easy to use.	Flatscreen TV
even though it is a little pricy, i like my new kindle voyage. it looks smaller, but it is because it's only the screen no buttons. it is lightweight. you can scroll and turn pages with touch screen press or with physical small buttons on the side. it is automatically adjusts to different light conditions.	Lightning Charging Cable
hands down the best ereader available. i researched several devices and it came down to the paperwhite and the voyage. there is a pretty hefty price premium for the voyage. most people will probably be very satisfied with the paperwhite. i typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. on an ereader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so i don't need to use the glasses. that means less text on each page and many more page turns. the physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. these were enough to sell me on the voyage. it was the right decision and i love the device.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i love to read books.paper and electronic via my ipad, but had never owned a kindle. when shopping at best buy, i mentioned to my husband that i might want to try a kindle.went to another area and, when i returned, the kindle voyage was in our basket. ok so i though i would give it a try. i love it! so compact, so easy to read my books and turn the pages without swiping or ? i highly recommend the voyage to existing and pending kindle readers. so many great features in such a small package!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
nice ereader. a bit smaller and definitely lighter than the paperwhite. 'whiter' screen still easy on the eyes. a bit expensive for just a reader however.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
pros light compact bright fast response from touch screencons hard to navigate. i use my old kindle with buttons to browse. this kindle can be frustratingwith its overly sensitive touch screen.overall a very good reader but no need to purchase if happy with paperwhite versions. for someone new to kindle it is worth the price as long as have another electronic device to browse the kindle site.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i bought this after my kindle keyboard died. i like having a dedicated reader. its easier on my eyes. its light weight and fits in my purse with the cover on it. the ads don't bother me. great purchase	Wired Headphones

i have been a kindle reader for years now but this is the first device i have used with a backlight and i have to say the eye strain is lower and the reading experience better than ever. for a pure reading device i do not know how it could be better other than lowering the price tag.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i've enjoyed the original kindle with keyboard for many years, and it was finally time to upgrade. the light is great, and i use the page press buttons exclusively. very happy with the size, weight, and appearance of this product.	Vareebadd Phone
nothing will replace the joy of flipping through the pages of a book, but living in a studio apartment with my girlfriend, i simply don't have the space for all the books i'd like to own on top of the ones i have now.i got this for my girlfriend because she has difficulty reading on my ipad air. she has no difficulty using her kindle voyage, and she thoroughly enjoys it.i'm actually thinking of getting one for myself farther down the line.

why carry a book when you can have a library at your fingertips? get one now!	27in FHD Monitor
i have had several kindles beginning with the 1st generation. i am an avid reader and i love that i can take my library with me. the kindle voyage is by far my favorite. the printed page is very clear and the lit page is wonderful. if you enjoy reading as much as i do, this is the ereader for you.

this is my 3rd kindle and i think its the best yet! love the new features and will never go back to paperback books again	Macbook Pro Laptop

reading on my commute, or in a waiting room, is a pleasant way to pass time and convenient	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
this ereader is great, i have started reading more now that i have this kindle than when i read paperbacks. if you are torn on buying this for yourself or someone else i can almost guarantee anyone would love this. with enabled dictionaries and xray i'm finally able to tackle books with a heavy character list like game of thrones. i'm serious, this is so convienent and user friendly. the only negative about this device is the amount of money you will spend on new books in excitement when you first connect to amazon with it.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle! it's great for downloading reading books. it's especially great because i can read regardless of the lighting conditions!	34in Ultrawide Monitor
love the new look and feel of my new kindle voyage. i especially love how it adjusts the reading light automatically.	USB-C Charging Cable
it is a great investment. can read at night without disturbing partner. only disadvantage is if you lose your place it is a little difficult to find it. this could be user problem.	Macbook Pro Laptop
new kindle is so much better than paperwhite. kitty hair always used to get stuck around the borders of the paperwhite not a problem with the voyage.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i would have given this 5 stars but the touch response isn't always responsive. sometimes it acts like it is frozen, and then it turns the page after several seconds.i like the new features over the paper white as well. i love you don't have to pick up your fingers to turn the page.	27in FHD Monitor
very nice display and high resolution! a pleasure to read.	Wired Headphones
there is no better ereader available today. it costs a bit more, but the build quality is the best.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
very good ereader. like the back light very much. very light for carrying around.	27in FHD Monitor
bought this for vacations at the beach easy to read in the sulight.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
so user friendly that i had it for over a month before i read the owners guide to learn all the other features. makes reading a book effortless. a must have for the avid book reader.	USB-C Charging Cable
okay, so i am a slow adopter of using kindle readers, but i have made stupendous use of this since buying it. i use it at work for keeping up to date with business journals and reading books on management styles and skills. even my original intent was for use at work i find myself reading additional books for my personal entertainment more often. screen is very easy to read in varying light conditions and menu is easily navigated. i am thinking of buying more of these for gifts at work for my employees at christmas time.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i know there's a separate product page for the origami cover, but it's worth mentioning here as it is the ""official"" cover. the origami cover is ugly and i was skeptical, but i actually love it. it's weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a notepad. this actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open, in my opinion. it's hard to describe, but there are a lot more ways to hold the voyage when it's attached to this cover, and just generally is more comfortable to use. the origami part of the case works great as well. it stands vertically or horizontally if you're laying down and reading, this is amazing.	Wired Headphones
we upgraded from an older paper white and couldn't be happier.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

kindle voyage is easily the best ereader with an impressive highresolution display and it is very thin and light weight too. loving it.	Lightning Charging Cable
love this reader. i recently flew to texas. my reader made the trip relaxing and a lot more bearable. i love the ease of use. this device is so much better than a pad for readers. you can tuck it in a pocket or purse easily.	USB-C Charging Cable
i had an old sony ereader that i loved but it wasn't working too well anymore. i decided that a kindle was the only viable replacement on the market right now. looked at kobo also. so far, i like it. great screen, backlight on mine doesn't have the problems that others have complained about.	Wired Headphones
i'm so happy i bought this. it goes everywhere with me. best thing i have purchased in a long time.	Google Phone
the type resolution is fantastic and the screen brightness auto adjust compensates perfectly for both dark rooms and full sunshine on the beach!	Wired Headphones
i first bought the kindle paperwhite with the 300dpi screen, i didn't think the jump to the voyage was worth the 80 plus additional taxes. i read about the voyage and with georgia having the back to school tax free days and the ereaders qualifying i returned the paperwhite and purchased this one. boy am i glad i did.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought this for easier reading and it meets my expectations. great display fidelity.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great ereader. light and easy to use. only issue is a bit pricey.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought this as a gift. i think it is pretty decent both quality and design.	Lightning Charging Cable
i have had several kindle ereaders over the years also nook, kobo, and sony as well, i even had the original rocket reader i still have it and they have all improved over the years so it's not surprising that the new voyage is the best one yet. over all i prefer the kindle readers now and amazon has perfected the ebook experience so why go anywhere else.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
easy to use. comfortable to holdlightweight and good size. the light adjustment is great. easy to inadvertently turn the pagesometimes more than onestill trying to figure out how not to do that. over all, though very happy with it	Google Phone
i love my kindle voyage. it's light and oh so easy to use. it's wonderful to have so many books in a portable format!	LG Dryer
the kindle voyage 6 is better than the real thing. after wearing out a first generation kindle in our home, we knew we wanted something with versatility of the original with a few added features. the background light is a big plus as it allows my wife to read at night without having to keep the lights on. it's a great ereader at the right price.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
easy to use and get started with. have had no issues at all and would recommend.	iPhone
i purchased this to replace a 2nd generation kindle for my wife. she wanted it because of the backlight. the item exceeded her expectations. great battery life too. i took he old kindle but plan to buy me one of these in the future.	USB-C Charging Cable
the light from the page does not but a strain on your eyes when reading. i like how light it is to hold.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
slim fit in my purse, love the page turn ""buttons"". auto light adjusting is good!	Apple Airpods Headphones
replaced a v1 nook but this is not better for reading	Google Phone
i am extremely pleased with my kindle voyage. it lives up to the hype. it is slightly smaller and lighter than the previous version. the ambient light monitor works well. text is clear and very readable. my only negative comment would be that the battery does not seem to last as long as i expected. i have recently retired so i am reading more. i recharge the reader about every week and a half. that said, i am reading indoors and perhaps the ambient backlighting is on more than normal.	USB-C Charging Cable
my son truly loves his kindle. he uses it everyday.	Wired Headphones
bright screen which makes reading it day or night easy	Vareebadd Phone
i like the small size and auto adjustable lighted screen. with my old kindle i needed to have external light to read, but this one comes with the build one.	USB-C Charging Cable
i received this as a birthday gift and i love it. the autobrightness is amazing, the battery life is incredible, and the page turning feature is very useful. my only complaints are that it doesn't completely turn off, because it displays ads instead of showing a blank screen, and that the sorting and navigation could be more organized. other than those two things, which are a minors to a whole, this product is wonderful.	Lightning Charging Cable
i bought one for my dad, liked it so much i bought one for myself. even better than the paperwhite.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
its a great tool, however it was hard to use in the beginning. not sure what happened but i had a hard time connecting to the wifi at the hotel i was stating at.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i replaced my older kindle keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. page turning takes some getting used to i keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. you're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" i think this is a major design flaw. also, the audio option seems to be missing you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. also, no 3g. i almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so i'm stuck with it.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
was a gift. the receiver really enjoys it and was an upgrade from her previous kindle	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this reader is much more comfortable to hold than the paperwhite. it is not quite as light as the nook glowlight, but the screen is much sharper.	Apple Airpods Headphones
clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. long battery life.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
perfect reading light and long battery life. i really love it.	Lightning Charging Cable
great ereader. the pagepress feature is so much better than swiping to turn pages. my only complaint is that i had to turn the auto adjust light feature off as it doesn't seem to reasonably adjust based on where i am reading.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
absolutely love this new kindle! light, sharp, glass touchscreen and adaptive front light. very easy to use and read!	USB-C Charging Cable

great way to read books. the screen is readable in any light. add a waterproof case and you have the perfect beach or pol side library!	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i was impressed with the voyage overall. i especially like the light sensor feature because it makes reading enjoyable in all settings.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this was a move up from the paper white reader. i like the option of touch screen or using the pressure switches on on the side which you can adjust to your pressure that you prefer. sharp fonts refresh is fast and clean.	20in Monitor
i would recommend this to anyone. it's an absolutely amazing product. so light, the auto brightness is great and it's convenient to carry around with you.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

when my kindle paper white was damaged my fault, i was looking for a replacement. after reading many reviews online, both from ""experts"" and normal users, i chose the voyager. i've been very satisfied with it. i particularly like the pressure sensitive edges for turning pages.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
the kindle from best buy has made it easier for me to read. this is my first ereader. i like the voyage 6 for its brightness and speed, plus thelarge variety of reading material. i know amazon is in the business ofmaking money by getting me to purchase kindle books. however, i havefound several kindle books available for free from my public library. i will, no doubt, buy some kindle books elsewhere in the future. best buyhas been good to me. i did have a little problem finding someone in thestore who was wellinformed on this product but finally got what i wanted.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
my 8 year old son has a new found passion for reading now that he is using this kindle.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
purchased as a gift. it was a good choice. it is as advertised,	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
best reader ever. i've had a lot of readers like paper white 2013, kindle dx, bn nook and kobo aura hd before i get kindle voyage. but this one is really different.the only feature that i wish it'd support is memory slot! i guess amazon will add it to the next generation of kindles as well as kindle fires.	Lightning Charging Cable
i or a family member have owned every version of the kindle since it came out. this version has finally taken all of the best elements of the previous kindles and combined them into one unit. it is small and light, has both touch screen and button functionality depending on which you prefer i'm a fan of the buttons, and an excellent backlight. kindle battery life has always been excellent, and is no different here. i use my kindle daily, often for at least an hour at a time. the only downside is that i'm not sure what other features amazon could add to improve this version, other than perhaps making it lighter weight. by far the best ereader out there, and a worthy upgrade from a previous version	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle! it never runs out of battery. used it on a three week detachment and never had to charge it.	Apple Airpods Headphones
clear screen, buttons act up a little. after numerous days of review i feel that this was the best option.	Wired Headphones
i purchased this to replace my first gen paperwhite. the shadows on the bottom of the paperwhite always bothered me. i decided to upgrade to the voyage and it is much better. i like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dpi, and the consistent back lighting. i think the only issue i have with the voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and i sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually. but that's a small issue for an otherwise great ereader.	Lightning Charging Cable
so far so good,,,, wife very happy. misses her old one.	ThinkPad Laptop
went to buy the kindle paperwhite, but after comparing them sidebyside i decided to buy the voyage. i thought that the print was a little sharper and i liked the smaller and lighter weight. i have been using it almost every day and really, really enjoy it.	iPhone
hy husband loves his kindle.the back light so he can read anywhere with low eye strain is awsome	USB-C Charging Cable
love the ability to read in sunlight, create files.	Google Phone
bought this to read out by the pool. works great! only thing that could make it better would be if you could adjust text size for imported pdfs.	USB-C Charging Cable
the extra money for the voyage version is well worth it, as the screen is brighter, clearer, and easier on the eyes. the other specs are also nicer compared to other kindle versions, but the screen is what sold me.	Flatscreen TV
the original electronic book. bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. she's hooked and loves the kindle.	Macbook Pro Laptop
upgraded from an old 2nd gen kindle and this is much better	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love the adjustable font size and the front light which allows me to read in any lighting even without my glasses. pagepress allows me to turn page effortlessly and i can close my book turning it off and when i resume reading i'm right back where i left off. love it. capacity is unbelievable.	Wired Headphones
perfect size, able to slip in pocket. nice feel battery last long, clear screen. however if you read quickly if may find yourself sometimes when scrolling to next page more slow or you may flip and skip over pages if pressed lightly.	Wired Headphones
i like this reader. it is easy to read in daylight with no glare. it has an auto backlight that works well in all lighting situations. i like the links to the dictionary, encyclopedia and internet links in the indigenous. this reader utilizes them all.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i am so glad i procrastinated in buying an ereader.i was going to get the kindle paperwhite then the voyage came out i bought it and am so happy with it a joy to use.	Lightning Charging Cable
light, easy to read, large capacity and multiple ways to turn pages. what else can i say, it's a wonderful reader, especially in the florida sunlight. also, the iphone app that sync your ready progress is great for times you have your phone but not the kindle.	Apple Airpods Headphones
great for reading books. print is easily readable. there are a couple of font sizes to adjust to your eyesight, as well as different font types to choose from. it's very easy to change them on the fly without going deep into settings.it has nice features, such as dictionary, where you can quickly check unfamiliar words while reading, create notes, or write and read reviews.getting books to the reader is straightforward as well. if you have wi fi connection, all you need is to create account. the selected books will be automatically transferred to your reader.if you don't have wi fi, connecting the reader with usb cable should be enough, but make sure if that works before you buy it.battery charge lasts for a few weeks. you don't have to worry to charge it every day.the charger is not included though. either you can charge the reader through your computer or buy the charger.charger is faster and more convenient.there are a lot of websites offering kindle books, there's a big selection of free books to choose from too. public libraries, amazon, number of various websites provide wealth of readings for kindle.overall, i'm very satisfied with it.on negative note, i wish the screen was a little bigger, as i don't carry it around, and it's not cheap either.	USB-C Charging Cable
very good quality product. i bout as a gift for a friend, she loved it	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i own the previous version, now, with this one, i 20 times happier! everything works like a charm!. i think ive never read so many book like now!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this kindle is a great buy, pretty simple to use, very convenient.	Lightning Charging Cable
it makes reading at night much easier. easy access to books that are of interest.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
upgraded to this unit from a paperwhite that i left on a plane somewhere.i find this unit to be a lot crisper, a lot speedier, and overall more pleasurable to use.i purchased the amazon brand leathertype case with standup foot. it adds a bit of girth to hold on to, while reading.the unit is incredibly slim.battery life is excellent even when using the backlight.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i would highly recommend this reader for anyone. easy to download books and fast! love the fonts and sizes. lightweight. great for travelers.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
even better than the paperwhite, which have used regularly over the past couple of years.	Wired Headphones
i had used the kindle paperwhite for quite awhile before i got intrigued by the voyage seeing it in person. i was apprehensive about upgrading given the higher cost but it was entirely worth it. the paperwhite is lite in weight but somehow the voyage feels weightless. the screen is absolutely beautiful and to me the nicest feature is the screen is flush with the bezel around. little learning curve to the page press on the side but tweaking the settings a little i have it down now.	Apple Airpods Headphones
the kindle was as a replacement for an earlier model. its performance and ease of use are superb however, the battery life is far shorter than my older version. it wouldn't last from la to frankfort and the old one did.	ThinkPad Laptop
the voyage is worth the extra money. it's a wonderful device. very responsive and easy to use. i would highly recommend!	Apple Airpods Headphones
never thought i would enjoy reading again because reading a boundbook made my eyes to tired to finish one. with the voyage, i don't get that feeling.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i'm an avid reader and love the kindle voyage. i love the adjustable fonts and that it automatically adjust to the light settings. the push sides to flip pages but not if you accidentally bump the wrong side which has happened a few times. great battery life it's usually a couple of days before i have to recharge.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the kindle voyage is a wonderful product and i use it everyday for my reading. i take it to lunch and dinner each day.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
this was on my wife's christmas list. she loves it. easy to use.	Bose SoundSport Headphones

got this for my pre teen who took to it like a duck to water. it is great size and easy to pack	Apple Airpods Headphones
one of the things i love the most about my new kindle is it's size. it slides so nicely into my compact purse, protective case and all. another thing i've noticed is the lack of glare that i experienced with my old kindle. it automatically adjusts to the light and i'm looking forward to being able to read it on the beach without a struggle. i also love the battery life it goes on forever. the case i bought makes it possible to stand my kindle up in front of me and read while i'm eating a must for me i never eat alone	Apple Airpods Headphones
awesome thank goodness for the next week and we will have a good day	USB-C Charging Cable
what a fun toy this is! it was easy to learn to use, and if i needed help, the online user's guide is right there. purchasing books couldn't be easier, and there's no ""hard copy"" to dispose of when you'e done. i was able to check out a book from the public library with little effort. with so many lowcost or nocost books, as well as current best sellers, there's an endless number to choose from. you can use the search function to search by topic or title. i like using a stylus pen on the touch screen for that. i know i will enjoy my kindle voyage for a long time.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this is a great ereader, perhaps a little pricey but well worth the money. it is extremely light and the eink is very readable.	Google Phone
i've never really liked kindle's for some reason or another. this one looked and felt really nice. i knew that i would love it as soon as i got it out of the box. it has a very premium feel and is a great substitute for a book.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
love the backlight, great feature. very light weight almost too much so.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the words on the screen are very clear. if a hardcopy book's type is too small i can read it on kindle because i can make the size bigger. read many positive reviews of the ease of use, page turner, special functions and clear display that i was convinced to buy the kindle voyage	Wired Headphones
very nice and easy to use and the kindle is great.	USB-C Charging Cable
we bought this reader to replace a fire hdx that had seemed to go wonky. turns out a couple of system resets and the hdx is back to normal so i get the old one, she gets the new one.but i can highly recommend this reader the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent.

the touch page turner is great, you don't have to finger swipe. although it does take a little more pressure to use than i like i still think it is a great feature.	Lightning Charging Cable

i purchased this for my wife as a christmas present. she loves it, much better than the old sony reader she had which had limited books and was much more expensive.	Wired Headphones
first, the good news. the screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. best of all, it is so light and tiny esp. in the origami case that it is supereasy to carry around in a purse. love that. also it has an amazing battery life i have never had it run out on me and i don't even have to recharge it all the time. i thought this would be perfect but i am having two problems 1 turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my mucholder, nowdefunct kindle. if i don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying splitsecond black flash on the screen. the ancient kindle was easier. 2 about half the time, when i return to reading, the screen is ""frozen"" on the ad. it says ""swipe to open"" but no amount of swiping gets it going. i have to reach to the rear of the kindle which means disassembling the crimp in the origami to press the button on the back to get it to function again. there is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. perhaps i am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, best buy staff doesn't know.

the text is sharp and paper like in well lit conditions. when using the backlight in dark conditions it becomes less paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on lights. can set on automatic brightness level or manually set. slim and lightweight when not using a case which i appreciate most about this kindle. makes for easy holding and carryingpacking. practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. i also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. one con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. i would not say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight. in fact i would recommend the paper weight when its come down to price. im just someone who wants the best of the best so i bought 2 of these. one for my love as a gift, then i went and bought myself one. it was a well recieved gift and i aquired major browny points. we give them 4 thumbs up. we can read together in bed, in the woods, on the road or wherever we like. this is the voyager after all and it is intended to be with you wherever you go. i would give it 4.5 if that was an option.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i love my kindle voyage. it is very little weight and i love the page press that it has, don't even have to move your hand to turn the page. you can read it in the bright sun and in the dark which no over brand of tablets you can do that with.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

i purchased this for my son overseas as he had broken the screen on his last one. when he opened it he was amazed at the size and weight of this one. he also was very elated that all his books that he purchased immediately downloaded to the new one with his bookmarks in place. all in all a great purchase from an excellent company.

i like this kindle, but i am not sure it is worth the premium over the paperwhite. i previously had a kindle fire, which was fine, but this is definitely nicer for reading. but it all depends on what you need it for, and how often you will use it.	Wired Headphones
i had been reading on my ipad mini most of the time, but around the pool or at the beach, that was almost impossible. the voyage is great not only in bright sunshine but inside, even in a pretty dark room. the back light is great for just about any environment. the battery life is fantastic.

great product love the auto adjusting black lightlove the weight of the kindle light enough i can hold it with one hand an turn the pages	USB-C Charging Cable
i like the small, light weight size, and the adaptive lighting. but the page turning is too sensitive, skipping ahead many pages when i am just moving the kindle, and going back and then forward when i am trying to change just one page.	27in FHD Monitor

my kindle voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. i kept receiving emails from amazon about the software update. i switched off airplane mode, switched on wifi and shortly after the screen locked up. i have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me i will have to buy a new one. i am very annoyed. if i had left the software as it was my kindle voyage would still be working.

the screen flush with the sides is great. the glass feeling is really nice. i don't use the side buttons for page turning but only because of habit. they are great and the need for pressure allows me to hold the kindle without changing pages. but, the price is painful. it is a splurge purchase since the paperwhite is just about as good in nearly every respect.

i exchanged the paper white that i had bought for this voyage. this is thinner, lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite. still getting used to the archive system since i had a nook before, bit of a learning curve. but i like the kindle interface better than the nook, the book suggestions and shopping for books is much better. the only thing i miss is that the kindle doesn't tell you what battery you have left, it just shows you the bar in the battery symbol.	Wired Headphones
i think this is a great ereader, i think even better than the oasis that just came out. i do like that one but i love that this one seems sturdier and offers the automatic brightness adjustment and the vibration feedback when turning pages. one thing i didnt like was that it was hard to find where the page turn areas were at while reading in the dark. to remedy this, i bought a few aluminum button stickers and put them on the lines of the device	USB-C Charging Cable
i love the auto dim feature for reading at night! i have no problem reading in sunlight either. can be held with one hand and turn the page with the same hand. i have 3 other kindles and i use this one all the time.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i will start off with the fact that i like paper books a lot. i bought the e reader because it's light and can travel with multiple books. the interface is fairly easy to use and it holds a lot of books. the automatic light feature doesn't work as nicely as i would. overall i am happy with the purchase but there are features that could make it a 5.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
love it, love it! have had several different models. like this one the best. the kindle fire was nice but had a hard time reading at night.	Wired Headphones
i had the paperwhite, but this voyage is definitely better. the quality is better, screen is seamless with the edge, which makes it feel premium and delivers more comfortable reading experience. lighter than the paperwhite, love the pressure sensors to change pages. overall better experience reading experience than the paperwhite.	27in FHD Monitor

good replacement for a paperwhite. the addition of the page forward and page backward buttons is huge!	Wired Headphones
i upgraded from the kindle touch so i could have a built in light. the light is fantastic. while it took some getting used to the press buttons for page turning on the side, i love that too. can use it with one hand, and don't have to take hands off to touch the screen. the documentation could use some work. a diagram with what all those icons are that they refer to would be a big help. took me a long time to figure out how to get the reading progress to what i wanted. one thing, i hate the new bookmark method. the old 'corner fold' was easier and less intrusive. still can figure out how to delete from my clippings. also i wish amazon would come out with a case similar to an otter box. i don't want leather or auto turn on, which seems to be problematic on nearly every case i look at.

i had one of the original kindles and i found that i just absolutely quit reading and it was because of the bulk and size of the kindle. i decided to give this one a try and i absolutely love it and i'm back to reading every day and the reason is because it is more the size of a paperback. it's lightweight and i love that i can read at night without having have a light on. i did however purchase the geek squad protection after my dog that was sitting in my lap almost said it flying to the floor when he jumped up out of my lap	Lightning Charging Cable
it allows you to focus on your reading and not wandering to the internet. great for reading in the dark. no need to buy a small lamp to read in the dark and easy to read in the daylight. battery last a long time.	Flatscreen TV
this is my second kindle the first one lasted several years. i enjoy the ability to read in the dark without background light. the backlight works very well and does not have the eye strain that a tablet may have. with the touch surface, i find it a little too sensitive and have accidentally moved several pages. the side page turn works very well. much easier to travel with this unit than a large book.

i am really pleased with my new kindle, i had one of the oldest versions and was reluctant at first on getting this one, but oh boy, i hit the jackpot.if you have never owned a kindle you will be really pleased on how easy on your eyesight this thing is compared to reading on a tablet.battery life is amazing, i turned off wifi and got over 4 weeks of battery life by reading around 1 hour a day, i recharged it before it was completely depleted.the addition of backlight is actually cool, even reading before night it did not disrupt my sleep cycle.and you get all the goodies of amazon backing up your digital content.overall i am very pleased with my purchase.

this is the 3rd kindle we have purchased and they keep getting a little nicer with each version. the light on this one is a really nice feature. the battery life is better, the page turning options are better, it is lighter. there are just a lot of nice little improvements. if you like to read in an electronic format i cannot imagine disliking the kindle.

i was fortunate to order one of these as soon as it was announced. as an amazon prime member, i was able to buy the fire tv stick for 19 during a two day sale. i figured, for that price, i might as well test it out!set up was easy and straight forward. i find that the interface is quick and easy to use. the interface and streaming on the stick is much faster than the amazon app built into my hdtv. this fact alone made this a great purchase. here are some more thoughts i have on the fire tv stick so far pros quick, easy to use, polished interface wireless streaming works really well amazon instant video loads, fast forwards, and rewinds really fast a dedicated prime menu allows prime members to easily see what free content is available unlike chromecast, the fire tv stick includes a remote can stream your own videos by first uploading them to your cloud disk can play quite a few casual games awesome, irresistible price for amazon prime users. i got it for 19 during the two day sale. better specs than chromecast and roku stick ultraportable. i plan to use fire tv stick when i travel for work and to visit family stream local videos and other content using the plex app thanks bikerider! cons included remote doesn't support voice search. that remote costs extra. would be nice to have a second fire tv stick model that includes the voice search remote, rather can requiring us to buy a second remote. probably won't be able to use universal remotes with this unless logitech offers a compatible device. not as fast as fire tv, but since the stick is so much cheaper, this is not really an issue.read more	USB-C Charging Cable
since the fire tv stick was announced, i've heard a lot of people wonder if it was something worth picking up, essentially asking what does this thing do that my tv doesn't do already the answer is going to be different for different people, but here's an easy way to think about it amazon fire tv stick is an excellent purchase ifyour tv is not a smart tv. meaning your tv or dvd player did not come preloaded with apps such as netflix, youtube, pandora etc.your tv is a smart tv, but apps do not perform well. some smart tvs have painful performance when streaming video, apps can be difficult to update, wifi connection can be spotty etc.you want to access youtube, netflix, amazon prime, pandora, and other such apps on your tvyou are an amazon prime member and want to access your prime video, prime music, and prime photo accountsyou want to participate in casual gaming on your television.you want to listen to music on your tvyou want to have portability. in other words, television access to the above services while you are travelling. amazon says the capability to use in hotelsdorms etc. with shared wifi that requires frequent password entry is coming soonso, the bottom line is that the fire tv stick allows you to access your movies, music and photos as well as games and more via your television. if your tv already does these things well, or you're already doing them via other devices such as a game console, then this may not be worth your while.so, how easy is it to use i'm telling you, you do not have to have an ounce of technological know how to have this thing up and running in a matter of minutes.read more	USB-C Charging Cable
update! 111115 more than a year now of using the stick literally every single evening for netflix, and it has been overall very reliable.bottom line this is the best streaming device for the dollarin my humble opinion it's cheap, it handles netflixprimehbogoplexgamesa lot more doesn't seem much slower than the full firetv box. i started with a roku2 in the living room which got pushed to the bedroom when i got the firetv box, then the firetv stick replaced the roku2. i tried the roku stick but returned it because it was just too darn slow. i'm completely firetv now and 100 happy with it.what it does it adds internetstreaming functionality to any tvmonitor with an hdmi port. you can use any of the thousands of paid andor free apps such as netflix, amazon prime, hulu, plex, news, digital fireplace, etc. there's a ton you can do. with some extra effort you can sideload things like kodi and 3rd party apps. it's super simple to use, and the image quality can be great if your internet connection is fast.the good stuff.same pricerange as the less capableless powered chromecast roku stickmore rammemory than the competitionkeeps things running smoothmore storage space than the competition, you can store more appsgamesetc.you can do some gaming with it, but the firetv box is better suitedso small you can bring it pretty much anywhere with ease.simple clean interface.lots of gamesapps to choose fromthe phone app is actually pretty usefulnot as good stuff.no connections other than usb for power, if you need ethernetaudio inout, get the box!read more	Lightning Charging Cable
i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.fortunately, i had friends who owned each, so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment.it's been a week and i am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! the touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. in any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading.also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon. extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and i didnt need to worry about customs, which i may have if i used a third party shipping service.	27in FHD Monitor
allow me to preface this with a little history. i am was a casual reader who owned a nook simple touch from 2011. i've read the harry potter series, girl with the dragon tattoo series, 1984, brave new world, and a few other key titles. fair to say my nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.fast forward to today. i have had a full week with my new kindle paperwhite and i have to admit, i'm in love. not just with the kindle, but with reading all over again! now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the kindle. the investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindle. you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazon.i have been reading the hunger games trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after. here is the thing with the nook that hindered me for the past 4 years i was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. there was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. however, with my paperwhite, i now have that feeling! that desire is back and i simply adore my kindle. if you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. after a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, i still have half of my battery left as well.make yourself happy. inspire the reader inside of you.	Apple Airpods Headphones
i am enjoying it so far. great for reading. had the original fire since 2012. the fire used to make my eyes hurt if i read too long. haven't experienced that with the paperwhite yet.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i bought one of the first paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and i suppose ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. i wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.for sundry logistical reasons, ive also made good use of amazons kindle app on my iphone. no paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the kindle.of course, there are aspects of the paperwhite which i would like to critique. ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.as a member of bookbub, i get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. i take on many of them, however, ive found that, even with the best will in the world, i cant keep up. some days it seems that for every book i read, ive bought two. theres just so much good stuff out there! the accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. its now at about 400.with this in mind, ive noticed that while pageturning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the kindle has become positively glacial. not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. the general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. this drives me mad. amazon states it can hold thousands of books. i believe them. but i figure i would need a second paperwhite to read while im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.read more	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have to say upfront i don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by apple or in this case, amazon. i like having devices on which i can put anything i want and use it. but.i was a fairly happy user of a nook touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since i live in serbia. then i lost the nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in serbia buying books with them, using their online capabilities except the kindle, and since no one except amazon ships to serbia, and since i've actually been a happy amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the kindle definitely has the best technology why not buy itso i did. what i read in many reviews about the screenlight of the paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. the light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches maybe you can see it in the picture at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. as you can see in the picture without the light there are no blotches with light out.the paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in serbia, and in these two days i've been using it, i'm a happy guy.i had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like amazon books, but that's fine. that's the one thing i'd like to see amazon do in some future upgrades make the kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion quotes and goodreads enabled and so on.the size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark like the light on a tab does. the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.so far, i can only recommend it.

my previous kindle was a dx, this is my second kindle in years. love the form factor and all but i do miss the physical buttons for page turning. there is a glitch in the software though. i use the english interface but occasionally i would like to translate words into traditional chinese. however, it seems that the traditional chinese characters cannot display correctly and become small boxes. the simplified chinese characters can be displayed correctly though.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
just got mine right now. looks the same as the previous generation except for the kindle logo it's black this time, feels a little heavier, the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one, but the resolution is so much better! the 300 ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money.totally recommend it for a book lover!i'll give it 4 stars instead of 5 because i am used to a cooler screen, but i'm sure i'll get used to this one soon too	Wired Headphones
as reviewed by the wife this is the perfect thing for a new mommy who loves to read books! as soon as i had my baby girl, i had to stop reading my novels because i had to give the baby my full attention. but how much time do i spend laying in bed, on my side, with the baby while she feeds especially prior to 4 months when feeding took as long as 45 minutes! not to mention cluster feeds during growth spurts! a book was out of the question because it's sooo tiring to hold up in sidelyingbreastfeedingposition. my new kindle was the solution! it's light, easy to disinfect i use baby wipes on the case whenever i feel like it's not clean enough to go on the bed with the baby and you don't need to keep a finger in the middle of the pages to keep it from closing you know what i mean!and for some reason it's much easier to go through a book with a kindle compared to an actual book. i never thought i'd be converted into the kindle culture but here we are!

my new kindle paperwhite came from the usa to a small town in sweden in just five days. payment of tax and customs handled by amazon. had not the ups been so square they think everyone sits at home all day i had received it a day earlier.i am very pleased with the ereader, easy on the eyes, and comfortable to hold in one hand. even if i buy many books from amazon i also want to read books in the epub format. a positive surprise was how easy it is to convert epub format to amazon's own format. i use the program calibre and then i just send the book as an attachment in an email to my kindle. quick and easy!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
had older model, that you could text to speech, this one hasn't. liked the smaller size, but having to buy a different cover! still getting used to shelf quite different from my 4 year old model.paper white is nice reading.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
this is a review of the kindle paperwhite launched july 2015. essentially. the same as the previous kindle paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded 300 dpi screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. this review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.before i start, ive noticed several complains about kindle not supporting the epub format used by canadian public libraries. dont be put off, theres a solution in the frequently asked questions section below.this review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. if youre in a hurry ive included a summary at the start, and a frequently asked questions section at the end.summary what can you do with it read a book. it can store 1,000s of books take an entire library away with you on holiday. buy a book. you can browse the amazon kindle store, and buy books over a wifi connection borrow a book. using the kindle owners library you can borrow one of 60,0 books if you have amazon prime membership share your books. using amazon family library to link two amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family highlight a section. using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. if several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated. record a bookmark. to come back to it later read a book on your kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder track a characters appearance throughout a book using the x ray feature. read for weeks without needing to recharge typically 46 weeks share you books multiple kindles on the same account, or family sharing access every book you've ever owned on the cloud available for download within seconds over wifi or 3g.what devices are availableas of july 2015, amazon have the following kindle devices on sale1. kindle 6 around cdn 792. kindle paperwhite 6th generation 212 dpi launched october 2013 around cdn 1292. new kindle paperwhite 7th gen 300 dpi launched july 2015 around cdn 1392093. kindle voyger around us 219289 doesnt seem to be on sale in amazon canada4. kindle fire 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around cdn 300400so you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. which to buy here's a quick summary in order of cost. the entry level kindle an entry level black and white eink book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.a terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. for the technically minded, it has a 1ghz processor and 4gb of memory with an eink display. essentially this means it's a black and white b fantastic to read even in bright sunlight c requires very little power hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours. new kindle paperwhite launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a supersharp display with 300 pixels per inch the same as the top of the range voyage. the high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original paperwhite to 6 weeks but still a very long time.compared to the existing 2013 paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.if you have an existing paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. however, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance. the voyage far more expensive that paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. it has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the ereader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. the back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new page press buttons on the side to turn the pages. when the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback nice touch. it has 4gb of storage same as the paperwhite, and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.although it has the same sharp 300 dpi screen as the paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. this means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. in addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. to compensate, the voyage automatically softens the light slightly. a lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device. kindle fire tablet computer the kindle fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the kindle range. similar to the apple ipad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life hours rather than weeks. although you can read books on a fire using the amazon kindle app, youll find the kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading emails, the kindle is a dedicated book reader device.unlike a kindle, the fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. the paperwhite and voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white backlight which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.finally, unlike the rest of the kindle range, the fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. the kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.what other options do i havehaving decided upon the model kindle, paperwhite, voyage or fire, the next decision is around special offers ie. adverts 3g or wifi connectionpersonally i have no issue with adverts on a kindle. they only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.the 3g option is a more difficult question. this effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books overtheair instead of at home or near a wifi hotspot. personally i went for the wifi model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. of course if you wont have wifi at home, then youll need the 3g option.one point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a personal hotspot or local wifi signal that your kindle or indeed any other wifi device can connect to. got to settings personal hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your wifi only kindle while youre out and about.conclusionif you love books but your on a budget, the original kindle with wifi and special offers is a great option. youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white backlight and super crisp display of the papwerwhite.the kindle paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi supersharp screen. finally, theres the top of the range voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.if youre in the market for a tablet computer then the kindle fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the kindle. myself i have both a paperwhite and an ipad air 2. i was skeptical at first, but the kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand on the train, and the backlight and long battery life a huge bonus.frequently asked questionsq what file format will a kindle reada kindle format 8 azw3, kindle azw, txt, pdf, unprotected mobi, prc natively in addition to html, doc, docx, jpeg, gif,

four children and share your books with the entire familyq. can i use a kindle to read in beda. yes. but only on the paperwhite and voyage models. its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. for the base kindle model youll need the light onq. are there any free books availablea. yes! over 40,0 classic titles are available for free out of copyright, and they can be legally downloaded. if you have a amazon prime membership you can also borrow a book from the kindle owners library which includes around 60,0 books.q how long does the battery lasta depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. ive certainly found ive gone for weeks without charging the deviceq how long does it take to chargea from absolutely flat, around 4 hoursq how many books will the kindle holda literally thousands. you can also download every book youve ever owned from your amazon account so the list is quite literally unlimited.q do i need anything elsea youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a usb socket as the kindle range doesnt come with a charger but the fire does. amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. some people also buy a cover, but i think this is not really needed. it adds to the weight, and is not really needed. it will protect your kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag.	iPhone
i love my kindle! i got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it! so i decided to get one for myself as well and i am glad i did. it is very easy to read books in it. i love the dictionary on this little device. normally i just skip a word i don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, i just press and hold my finger on the word i don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! if you love to read books, i highly recommend kindle.however, if you only read manga or comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books i do not recommend kindle for you. it is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.so if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!if you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores.	iPhone

only 4 stars because i found it very confusing at first. i had a kindle before found it very easy to find what i needed to do. the user guide didn't really answer my questions, but i persisted am getting used to it. i really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages. at first i wasn't sure about the smaller screen, but didn't take long to get over that. i'm sure i'm just a creature of habit not very techy. all in all, the kindle paperwhite is great.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
almost like reading a real book. don't is crisp, sharp and easy to read. i've held out from buying a reader for years because i could never quite get past the fact it wasn't a book. with this new kindle i don't even notice, i am immediately immersed. wildly better than i expected.

i already had an original kindle paperwhite and loved it. buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but i am so pleased i made this move. i love the new font and the clarity of the screen. i love that the kindle comes to life when i open the cover i bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp. while there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel i have made a great purchase which i am happy with. i also have a bunch of books from my amazon.co.uk site which i access on my 'old' kindle i couldn't work out how, if at all, i can move books from one amazon jurisdiction to another so this has proved a good purchase all round.

i had previously purchased the first kindle fire for reading but i would get distracted with all those other apps you can get on it. when the kindle paper white came out i decided ill give it a try. i love reading in the dark with it and that it looks like the pages in a physical book. i also love the word wise it helps to review words you didnt know later if you want, growing your vocabulary.

i had one of the original kindles and gave it to my daughter when i got an ipad. as much as i love my ipad, it's not ideal as an ereader. after a trip or two this summer to the beach with a good old fashioned paperback, i figured i'd try out the new kindle paperwhite. i'm so glad i did! it is small, lightweight, and holds a charge for days! i love it, and have been reading book after book since my purchase.

comments on kindle paperwhite1 basic functioning of page forward back excellent2 footnote action often led to loosing place. it was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. pressing the top right x sometimes returned to text, but often was dead requiring selecting go to footnotes. picking the correct footnote returned to correct position but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote send me off to wrong text position. while doing things right raises no problems it is to easy to get in trouble. enabling the x at all times would be safer.3 occasionally a small print message such as 91 highlighters would appear between the lines. supposed to show where other kindle users highlighted text. does not highlight any text.

you will not regret this purchase! the kindle holds a charge for more than a week, is super light weight, easy on the eyes, and allows you to define words with the point of a finger! it even adds defined words to a vocabulary list, so you can review them!	Wired Headphones
i prefer the deficated ereaders to tablets for reading. i have both this paoerwhite and a currentgen nook glow light. i really like the glow light especially its rugged construction and i still use it, but the paperwhite is better.the glow light has no bevel and a touchsensitive button on the front. this means i am constantantly turning the page or returing to the home screen by accident. it's very annoying, and i have a hard time finding a comfortable way to hold it. it seems like i'm always thinking about where my fingers are. i do not have this problem at all on the paperwhite.the paperwhite is a great little reader for the money. i would definitely buy another.	Google Phone
i would recommend this to you. this product is really light and portable. you can carry it to caf or library for reading. there is no harm to your eyes because of it specific technology. the only drawback is that it will flash when you turn the page. but this is the common problem for this kind of reading stuff. i think it is acceptable. i bought on the price of 99 with a 25 discount. so it really worth it.	USB-C Charging Cable
got this for my fianc and she loves how easy it is to use, and how light the product is. would highly recommend to all book readers.	Wired Headphones
bought for our child who has vision issues but loves to read. she can borrow library books and they return ""automatically"". appreciate that the screen lighting is more gentle than other tablet items. grateful for no game options. wish i could control the ads better! that's my only complaint. some advertised books are plain wrong for a young one but there it is with a sample or picture. just gotta keep an eye on that.

purchased this as an upgrade to the first generation kindle paperwhite. the backlight is greatly improved, the display is of a higher quality, the words are clearer and the internal process is a lot quicker opening books and page flipping is noticeably speedier.the one thing that does annoy me about the 3rd generation paperwhite is the way it's manufactured when you hold it at a certain angle and you look at the bottom of the screen, you can see a small section of the display covered in the eink used to render the words and images on the rest of the screen. at first i thought this was a manufacturing defect, so i took it back to best buy and exchanged it for the same model, only to find that the second model had the same issue, except morevisible.this appears to have something to do with the way the display is placed behind the bezel during the manufacturing process. when the paperwhite first came out, it was the crown jewel of amazon's ereader line, and amazon was careful to precisioncraft the devices. now, that honor falls to the moreexpensive voyage, with the paperwhite becoming the flagship, but still cheaper, option in the kindle lineup, meaning the manufacturing quality of the paperwhite is likely a bit reduced compared to that of the voyage.this won't be a huge annoyance for some people. it is for me. and it's seriously made me consider whether it's worth contacting amazon over.for everyone else, though, this is a great ereader and well worth the money. if you're looking for an ereader, this is the one to buy.

it took a bit for me to get used to the kindle as i was used to reading the books on my phone with the kindle app. i was a bit bummed with losing the color. i also dont like that it has no sound. other than that it's a nice lightweight device with a good battery life. at first i thought it was defective because it froze up the first time i plugged in the usb. it actually stayed frozen for a couple days before it finally started working again.

i bought an extra power cord for my echo a month ago but it has been on backorder. then when i went to check, it was not scheduled to ship for another few weeks. i then saw this one, and it is new. i placed an order for it and it was at my door in two days with prime.i love my echo and wish i could buy another at the introductory rate that i did a year ago. we use it daily in our household, mainly for news and listening to music while cooking in the kitchen. we wanted another one for the main bedroom for the alarm, weather, and music. having poor eyesight, it is nice to ask alexa what the weather is rather then trying to find my glasses in the dark. i bough the extra cord and plugged it into my nightstand. i now unplug the one in the kitchen and plug it into the bedroom. within a minute it is back online.so much easier than buying two echos. feels solid and just like the first one, very pleased.	iPhone
these are made for the echo and as i use my echo in a couple ends of the house so it is convenient to have the two of them	Lightning Charging Cable

i purchased this item back in the first quarter of 2017. i returned this item within 30 days of purchase. i mailed it back per instructions by amazon. today may 26 i received an email from amazon that they failed to receive the item by jul. 20 so they will charge my credit card. i have to assume that someone in amazon receiving did not do their job loging in the item or us mail lost the item. either way i am screwed.	USB-C Charging Cable
my kitten chewed through the power cord that came with our echo and i had to order a new one. i was disappointed that i had to buy another plug instead of being able to buy a replacement cable like most usb cables. i bought a cord protector for this echo power cord so that hopefully i won't have to buy another one due to a destructive kitten.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
thanks to amazon for standing behind the product they sell, mine quit working after a year and replaced it. great!	USB-C Charging Cable
my amazon echo did not power back on after we had a loss of power, even though we had it plugged into a surge protector. i am almost a full year out of warranty for my echo and amazon sent me this power plug for free and almost like magic my echo came back to life as soon as it was plugged in with this new power adapter. yay, we have alexa back in our lives! hooray!	iPhone
a while ago, my echo power supply stopped working. at the time, amazon was out of the oem power supply and provided me with a replacement from china. that one worked but was bulky and not as good looking as the oem one, so i decided, when amazon had caught up with back orders, to reorder a 'real' power supply. very glad that i did.sleek, stylish power supply for my amazon echo. works as it should, and hopefully will last longer than my previous power supply!	Apple Airpods Headphones
as expected but cost too much. i felt amazon should have covered the failed power supply under warranty but this fixed it.	USB-C Charging Cable
i bought this thinking it was needed for the echo that i purchased. it was not. however if i ever want an amazon fire tv it will be ready.	USB-C Charging Cable
my echo's power adapter began making a tiny but very audible noise that was disconcerting. my echo continued to work well, but i needed to get rid of the aggravating and disconcerting noise, so i bought another adapter. this adapter works without making any noise. i am pleased with it.

this tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. the built in amazon pieces for prime members is great and work flawlessly. but it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes. they need to take a lesson or two from apple.	USB-C Charging Cable

i like it a lot. got it just to be able to get on line while husband was on the laptop but there is so much more. very user friendly. a few basic directions and you breeze through most set ups. i can check the breaking news, weather or look up an address etc. be out the door meanwhile the laptop is still booting. the fire shut down moko case is merely shutting the cover. weak spot for listening to music has rather poor sound but movies, shows, voices etc are clear fine. will be getting the fire stick shortly. no opinion on cameravideo yet.	34in Ultrawide Monitor

the kindle fire hd8 6th generation is wonderful! my old, old, old one was the 7"" screen which was fine, but the 8"" is even nicer. it still fits easily in my purse to take along with me. it's great having the camera which takes nice pics. i haven't tried the ""alexa"" feature yet, so can't say much about that. the blue shade feature is wonderful for night time reading in bed. with my old one, even on the lowest setting, it would still disturb my husband sometimes. the blue shade provides a soft, gentle color that is easy to read and easy on your eyes. using the internet is much quicker and smoother on this version as well. it's just better suited to it than my older version was. my only complaint is that the choices for cases are much more limited than cases for the older versions. after lots of searching, i found one on amazon that i really like, but didn't have much choice in designscolors.overall i love my kindle!	27in 4K Gaming Monitor

i bought this for my sister after her child stepped on her laptop and broke the screen! she is in love with it it's just the right size for her to do her photo editing, surf the web, watch videos, etc. it's quite durable as well seeing as how a fouryearold has his hands on it quite often the only thing that could be improved is the camera quality but we didn't buy it to take pictures with. just to edit them!

this little tablet was a great purchase. my kids used it on a long trip, and they mostly watched videos and played games. the screen is pretty poor compared to higherend models, but it's pretty great for the price. there are certainly superior tablets out there, but if you need a cheap tablet, this is certainly worthy of 5stars for the class. the operating system, the touch screen, and the screen quality themselves are drastically lowerquality than a surface, ipad, or galaxy tablet, but so is the price. so as long as you aren't expecting this device to rival an ipad retina screen, you should be pleased.

very parent friendly! extremely thorough parental controls. we were told at the store there was no way to block internet or control other content on a tablet, so we decided not to get one. then, we read about the integrated parental controls with the fire and gave it a try. it allowed us to do everything we wanted and more. also, very easy set up and use!

bought this for my mom who is 93 and her other fire deceased. it was very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her account information. she has really enjoyed using it and has even started using some new apps. due to her age and my not living closer, it would be nice to be able to have a print copy of how to do things. otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i had known amazon was going to release the next generation a few weeks after i bought this one! otoh, my wife is happy with it. it just offended my geek side. however, it has alexa and integrates well with my philips hue equipment.	Apple Airpods Headphones

i love my kindle fire! i like the bigger screen of the hd8 versus the 7.	iPhone
i also have a fire and like it's overall performance.	Wired Headphones
for the price, it's tough to get a better tablet than the kindle fire. it's not the same quality as higher priced tablets, and you're locked into amazon's ecosystem, but if you're an amazon prime member and are looking for an affordable tablet, the kindle fire is a good choice.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)

steady learning new things daily on my new kindle.	Wired Headphones
this was just the right screen size. we were price shopping and luckily found it on sale too.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
this tablet was very reasonably priced and easy to use. i find that i am using it much more frequently than i thought i would. the only gripe that i have with it is that it's hard to download apps that are not amazon connected. i'm still trying to get dropbox for example.	Wired Headphones
tablet is a bit smaller than i imagined for an 8"" tablet and thin and flimsy i don't like super thin tablets. the color is a bit washed out and there is no way to make the colors darker or richer. frustrating that you cannot use google play store and the sound is not very loud either. it's ""ok"", i expected it to be better but for simple uses it's fine. photos are also grainy and faded. it does record in rather low lighting which helps me personally and the battery charge holds a long time. the tangerine color is also very nice and it's fairly simple to use. overall, i would have expected a better product, but again for simple use it's ok. will upgrade to a better product eventually. i was spoiled by my 2013 color nook.	Lightning Charging Cable
very basic. if you need more than the basics, look for an android tablet.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
nice and light. does not have as good of battery as advertised but still very nice.	27in FHD Monitor

tablet is very good. i have a lot of apps and pretty much do my homework there	iPhone
got this for my wife for reading kindle and ordering on amazon. it is a nice unit, has quick response time and was a good value.	Lightning Charging Cable
solid tablet with good performance, wifi connectivity and app availability. it doesn't have all the breadth of apps that ios or android has, but the choices are reasonable. most importantly for me, this fire hd tablet is a very good web browser, ereader and video streaming device. so, i would rate it highly for these functions alone	LG Washing Machine
this is a great device for book readers! it's larger than the former kindle, has great light and easy to operate.	Macbook Pro Laptop
i live on my fire tablet and love this one, great graphics and speed	USB-C Charging Cable

this tablet really help me out, as a great gift for my nephew	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i bought this case for my son, fits perfectly! easy to put on, love it!	AA Batteries (4-pack)
the only thing holding this device back is amazon's unwillingness to play nice with other media companies and as a result it is very difficult to obtain certain digital items on this device if it is not immediately available on the amazon store. even so, very good purchase.	USB-C Charging Cable
bought for my mother in law and she hasn't had any issues with it. runs her games and internet browser fine.	Lightning Charging Cable
my mom was looking for a affordable tablet. i bought mine at best buy last november. i recommended the fire tablet and she loves it.	USB-C Charging Cable

it is easy to use is small compact. i can read my email, shop, read books., take pictures play games all at my fingertip.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
easy to use for a beginner. this is my first tablet and i thought i'd have to take advantage of the free setup but i didn't . i love being able to take it with me so i can read while waiting places and not have to carry two books if i'm close to the end of one. i also love the camera. my personal camera was always low on battery power but now i can take my kindle fire with me and take photos when ever i want.

i bought this new kindle fire hd 8 just to have a larger device. i've had a 7 for many years and love it. this is just a case of size does make a difference. the only downside is that the multiple chargers i've got don't fit the 8 so i'm left with just the one that came with the device.	Apple Airpods Headphones

needed something smaller than a laptop to carry around. this is perfect.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i'm truly elated with the amazon fire hd 8 tablet. i originally purchased this product specifically to attached to my tablet holder on my nordic track treadmill, which already has a builtin tablet. however, i was so taken back by the versatility of the fire hd 8 tablet that i decided to use the tablet as my everyday ""walkabout"" computer tablet instead on placing on my treadmill which i only use 1 to 3 times per week. i totally recommend the fire hd 8 tablet which on sale cost about 69.00.	AA Batteries (4-pack)
i have never had so many issues with a kindle and i have purchased alot. it's slow. it shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. and when it does it seems to be downloading it. and it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when i do . very very stupid . it has cracked . and i have never dropped it . it isn't made well. i am going to return it and i will probably never buy another kindle . horrible	AA Batteries (4-pack)

what you think you need more than a kindle to surf the web? you don't. cheap and effective. plus it's an alarm clock too, plus with the right apps it's a radio, what's that you say a clockradio? you know it hipsters.	Wired Headphones
ordered one for my daughter. it's the fourth kindle we have bought and love them. perfect for watching videos and movies.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought it for christmas. the picture is great and memory is plenty	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
the general use for this tablet is only worth for amazon users mostly so unless your buy and use amazon products, i don't recommend this to anyone else. the tablet is not excellent compared to others but it is fairly good for an affordable price.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
bought this for my sister. this has replaced her i pad. she loves it.	34in Ultrawide Monitor
i had to replace my original kindle and decided to buy the kindle fire. the fire has so many more abilities than my old kindle but it is difficult to read in direct sunlight.	Lightning Charging Cable

it is an amazon amazing among many things that can be used by many people and always will be a good product to use for many people to tryout and have an important experience for their family. amazon kindle fire 16gb with side that has slot for the extra memory in the form of a memory chip.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
bought this for a christmas gift, the item is great	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
it has a delayed response. i can't access my email accounts unless i give amazon access to control everything. i can't put my apps on my opening page. amazon uses the washington post, i prefer the nyt. so far not a fan.	USB-C Charging Cable
you can't get much better than this for the price. my only critique is that they might as well have not included the camera because it's useless, but if you're using a tablet for the camera than that is already an issue. good quality resolution, fast for internet browsing, expandable memory. lots of positives to be found here.	27in 4K Gaming Monitor
this tablet is one of the best.you won't regret buying this one.good work,amazon.	Wired Headphones
just picked up from bb a couple of hours ago. screen in good and tablet seems faster than previous model possibly due to more memory. battery so far seems very good.	AAA Batteries (4-pack)
i've had this tablet for several months now and have had no problems with it. 8 in screen is perfect easy to hold, not too big or too small. 16gb romabout 12gb available after updates and built in apps is good if you don't have a lot of apps or games. the ram could be bigger but it doesn't lag even with some medium gaming. 1.5ghz processor is not for heavy gaming, but for everyday use is great. the battery life is excellent i would say easily 8 hours or 5 to 6 if gaming. while this is not a hd display the colors are sharp, some glare if in the sun. camera sucks but decent for the price, no issues connecting and syncing my data to my amazon account. if you are an amazon prime member definitely buy this tablet and even if you aren't this tablet gives you a lot for the price. i wish amazon would offer more than 90 day warranty but overall very impressed and satisfied with my purchase.	Apple Airpods Headphones
my only problem with this tablet is that after 6 months of use it stopped charging.	Wired Headphones
good product if you don't want to spend money on ipad. great just for surfing internet.	ThinkPad Laptop
bought as a mother's day gift. this is great for someone who does not already have a tablet, and is a bit uncomfortable with technology. the tablet guides you pretty well, and once we had it setup with overdrive, the recipient was very happy. free library kindle books!	ThinkPad Laptop
i love reading my books on this kindle. a little slow on processing on the web.	Bose SoundSport Headphones
i have enjoyed my kindle since purchasing it over 5 months ago. as a law student it's a great way to have all of my books on one device and accessible on the go.	Lightning Charging Cable
